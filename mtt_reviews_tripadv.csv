RatnaPrasad,"Hyderabad, India",Considering large scale fraud transactions on International Credit Cards all of Airlines websites and Travel Portals are validating on case to case basis which are specific to International Credit Cards only. No harm in sending it its a large travel portal in India.
brave1,"Kolkata, India",Makemytrip is one of the leading Indian travel portals. Used them couple times myself also. They are a bit cautious about foreign cards to avoid fraud. Don't worry about it.

bpinheiro,Houston Texas,"I regularly buy tickets from them. No problems at al. They are a reliable and trusted site.They probablyt are only protecting the card holder from fraud, therefore asking for the scanned copy of the credit card. Make sure it is makemytrip.com asking you for yourcredit card scans. You can contact them on their phone number on the website, its 1800... something, give them the makemy trip reference number and other details athey will confirm.I regularly buy tickets from them.

Abhideep,Manassas VA,"I wanted to write a review for make my trip so badly, but never found any place on their website to post it. This summer I booked Golden Triangle Trip through them. Their customer Rep Jitesh Sharma was in contact with me through out the process. We booked 2 nights in Delhi, 3 in Jaipur 1 in Agra and then again 2 in Delhi. On our way to delhi we missed our conecting flight from Paris. i called Jitesh and informed it. So there goes our one night in Delhi. I never asked for refund, nither did he offered it. It was less than 48hrs notice, so there was no point asking it. When we reached Delhi the airport pick up was not arranged. After calling several times, it was arranged. I specifically told him that I did not want any place in Pahad ganj. well he tricked me saying that the hotel was in the center of Delhi. and was close to all the attractions. we satyed in Delhi city center. The hotel was OK but the area was so bad that I thought we would fall sick. Meanwhile as soon as we reached Delhi after the pick up incident Jitesh Sharma dissappeared. All the cell phone numbers he gave me suddenly stopped working. I must have called Make my trip atleast 10-20 times and requested for him. But it was waste.Jaipur hotel was great. Agra hotel Siris was fine. Their bottled water smelled like toilet cleaner and made us sick. I requested them to change my hotel in Delhi, but they did not. Also the places I wanted to shop their driver would not take me. he would make some reason to avoid it and then take to us very expensive shops or restaurants (where 4 chai, 2plates samosa would cost you RS1000). I have booked my air tickets through them. I have a good experience with that. They never emailed me or contacted me for feedback. hope this help."
GurgaonBased,Delhi,"I have used the site on multiple occasions to make flight as well as hotel bookings. No problem at all. If you feel worried, why not book with them and then confirm the ticket directly with the airline.Generally, airlines and travel agents [and even some retailers] ask for a copy of the CC if the transaction exceeds about INR 5000. You can easily give a copy but black out the expiry date and the 4 digit code on the front of the card if your card is AMEX. also, avoid giving a copy of the back of the card if your card is visa or Master since the back contains the 3 digit code. This way no one can transact with the photocopy and the company should be satisfied that you are the real holder of the card.If you notice, most of the negative posts are by persons having only one or two posts!"
GatherinNoMoss,Mumbai,"You are right, Gurgaonbased. There seems to be a sudden proliferation of one time posters all across the India forums either praising or slashing certain travel and tourism service providers. Makemytrip seems to be particularly negatively targeted.I myself have used Makemytrip for booking air tickets with no problem whatsoever.These days though, I get a marginally better deal from my local travel agent (they are small and overheads low)."
myfreerun,INDIA,"I am pretty satisfied with Makemytrip . I received very good attention from their travel executives Chandni and Ashima while fitting out my last minute modified Cairo trip from 1 to 3 of January, even with a cancellation thrown in. Although the charges were marginally on the higher side, the tie-up they gave me at Egypt ( Five star resort-Oasis , good Egyptologist etc) was excellent. I am bowled over by Oasis Resorts- it is slightly off maintown Cairo and nearer the grand pyramids - WOW ! I do not mind paying that bit extra if all my hassles are taken care of so well !

GatherinNoMoss,Mumbai,"I booked a domestic air ticket with MakeMyTrip yesterday. For a JetKonnect flight, I compared with what my travel agent was offering and what the airline's website itself was offering. I got the best deal at MakeMyTrip. The process was easy and seamless. E-ticket delivered to my mail ID within 5 minutes, alongwith Invoice. My card company confirmed that the amount taken off my card was the same as charged. Difficult to see how a booking can be declared bad after a PNR number has been issued. I shall post again in case something should go wrong.For a SpiceJet flight, I got a marginally better deal (less by Rs. 100) on the airline website. Not received my e-ticket as yet, so have to get back to the website and check whether I am supposed to print it out from the website itself.I do shop around, but was quite satisfied with the MMT experience yesterday, which has even improved quite a bit since my previous experience of booking through them."

cyberhippie,Holland,"In the end I rarely listen to reviews on forums such as this, or anywhere else, and always treat complaints with a pinch of salt.The obvious drawback inherent in the advent of the

sunbird2,"Brisbane, Australia","We used this company to pre-book many of our hotels, as we only had 4 weeks of travel and wanted to be sure of bookings for our family. Like this forum I had read good and bad reviews beforehand and decided to take the punt since there was more good than bad. To ensure that we did not arrive at destinations without bookings I made a point of sending emails to the hotels a couple of weeks prior to leaving. We discovered that one of the hotels had not been advised of our booking and we contacted MMT. The operator was extremely apologetic and helpful and everything was organised immediately. As we travel with children it is easier for us to arrive at a place with bookings and I would happily use this company again for that purpose. I also recommend sending emails beforehand to ensure bookings.We used this company to pre-book many of our hotels, as we only had 4 weeks of travel and wanted to be sure of bookings for our family.

Makemytrip_fraud,San Francisco...,"I used makemytrip.com for my trip from USA to India. My warning is - NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER USE THIS WEBSITE. Reasons.1. They said free unlimited airtickets in india if you book through make mytrip.com - All you need to do is give itenary and pay taxes!  - After booking tickets I called. They said i have 24 hours to send my request. I did for 2 destinations. Guess what? They wanted me to buy tickets as per their list price on website. When you inquire, they follow the following procedure a) Keep you on hold for 3 hours b) Standard statement: "" sorry sir our systems are down"" c) Sorry sir that is the price my system is quoting for taxesWhen you ask why is your website showing taxes as Rs 1200 and you are charging Rs. 4200 for same flight same ticket- they say"" sorry sir our system is down"" Basically drag it out of 24 hour limit they have and say time lapsed.Now your ticket!!!! They book through unrelated airlines with no code share or no business deals ( like kingfisher and Lufthansa). Route you through mumbai. Never tell you that domestic and international airport takes 5 hours to complete formalities. They lied saying that both terminals are in same airport and I need just 2 hours to board plane from domestic terminal. Trust me, It is a lie. My flight was delayed, I was stuck in domestic terminal with no shuttle that came fater 43 minutes i landed. Took 20- 25 minutes to reach international airport. I was late and they refused to check me in. With lot of pleading i did check in and to my horror immigration and security took 2 hours! My experience was Makemytrip is fraud, worst website, with ZERO customer support. if you want to fly from destination A to Destination B and do not care if flight is 3 hours late go ahead. But if you travel international, Makemy trip is not equipped to handle it. They lie, they do not know the rules, their systems is always down( wonder what it even means! for a webiste company) and they use unethical sales/advertising practicies to mislead people. AVOID MAKEMYTRIP.COM LIKE YOU WOULD AVOID the worst company on earth. In my opinion its the WORST OF THE WORST. I would never ever book through it again."

Vivek_Singh,"New Delhi, India","I clearly notice a trend, which is already quoted in one of the previous posts- most of the negative posts are written by those who have posted first time.I have booked both flights and hotels on many occasions, and never faced any problem. Whenever I've written to their customer support, they have responded promptly (BTW I didn't expect their response in 5 min).Those complaining about refund: please understand the refund takes place as per airline rules and it takes time. Before shooting negative posts, please have a look at the terms and conditions which is sent to your email. I have also seen people cribbing for refund after booking 'no change no cancellation flights.' You get here what you pay.MMT is the company which has changed the way people travel in India which was full of touts (and still is not free) and travel agent used to quote higher fare to earn high commission.There could be a few cases of goof ups, which can't be avoided looking at the scale of operation. Talk to them, they will sort things out. As already quoted by Sunjay, it has more than 50 per cent market share and it's going to grow looking at the way they are doing things.If you are a future traveller, you can trust this site BLINDLY.

fongerdonger,Los Angeles,"DO NOT USE makemytrip! BOOK DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRLINE!!I made the mistake of booking with them. They called me the night before my flight (Delhi to Udaipur) to tell me that there was a problem with my credit card and the flight was now full. I now had to book on another (more expensive) flight. I was a little weary because the agent was eager to get my credit card to book the new flight.This turned out to be a SCAM that makemytrip often employs on their customers (as we later found out from a foreign diplomat). They do this in order to bump you from your flight so you'll buy another flight and then sell your original seat to someone else.After multiple phone calls with makemytrip's agents to verify this claim, only to receive the run-around, we made it back to our hotel to jump on the computer.The charges had gone through my credit card no problem and our seats were confirmed on our flight as originally planned.SHAME ON makemytrip FOR TRYING TO SCAM THEIR CUSTOMERS.DO NOT USE makemytrip! BOOK DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRLINE!!"
cdg_01,Boston...,Don't buy from them.They will show one rate on the website and when you try to book they will charge your credit card first and then try to book the ticket with the airlines.if the bookign with the airlines fails your card still gets charged automatically and they take 7-8 days to give you a refund.Plus I had a very bad experience talkign to their Customer support.They will book your ticket with one set of rules and send you an email 30 minutes later with very restrictive rules for the ticket.I don't forsee them survivng long in the US market if they treat their customer is such a shoddy manner.

After the credit card payment was processed we noticed that we had been put on a 4:45pm flight instead. When we called Makemytrip, we were informed that this happens often and they put us on an earlier flight because tickets were not available on the later flight.We asked them to cancel our ticket and they said that a cancellation would be subject to charges of Rs. 300/person. This even though they put us on another flight and not due to any error on our part.We were also told that refunds will take 7 days to complete. We waited for one hour to speak with a supervisor, who refused to speak with us. We have reported this to our credit card provider, who is now disputing the charges with MakemyTrips.I am Indian and have used MakemyTrips in the past with no prior bad experience. So this is disappointing. But we think it is important to share this and stop a website from committing fraud."

DineshA2,"Ann Arbor, Michigan","It's my mistake. I have lived long enough in India to realize how things work there and what to expect from an India based website. I was chatting online with an agent to get a ticket booked frokm India to US and back. I told her the Airline and the seats I want, which I could see on the preview map. To my surprise the instant I decided that I want the ticket the price of ticket went up by about Rs3000. When i said I will book it directky through the website and I looked at the seat map, the seats that i wanted were gone (occupied). All within a span of 30 seconds. So, I declined the ticket following which I received a call from this lady who thne basicaly pushed me into getting a ticket. Now, the very next day I see that the same flight, similar seats were available at a much cheaper price!! To make the matters worse, I was charged twice for the same transaction because of which my credit card account went into negative. DO NOT BUY TICKETS FROM THIS WEBSITE.

DineshA2,"Ann Arbor, Michigan","Don't you think I must have tried to contact MMT before writing this review? It's almost 2 days now and no word from them. The only reason I am not pulling my hair out is because I trust AMEX who will dispute the charges on my behalf after they are billed. Further, what would one say about the sudden increases in the price of the flights? When I tried to book the flight myself on the website, the price went up and the seats which I were looking at disappeared. The same seats magically appeared once the booking clerk intervened. The next day I noticed that price of the same flight dropped by more than 100 USD and is about the same price on the website of American Airlines. When MMT can charge someone elctronically in the blink of an eye, then they should also have the courtesy and professionalism to make a refund in the similar manner. AND, believe me, once you deal with any buisness here in USA, your worldview about what is ""good and happy"" would change. I just hope there won't be any more surprises waiting for my family in India at the airport. -Dinesh"

To make the matters worse, they charged me twice for the same transaction which sent my creditcard over the limit and my credit was frozen. The only reply that I got from them was to send them a statement so that they can make a refund. I tried my best but could not make these imbeciles understand that the charges which are pending cannot be shown on a statement unless they actually bill it. I even sent them the approval codes from American Express and the time they ran my card throgh their system. They just stopped responding.

I had used them to book international flights from Delhi to London more than a year ago. Later, I cancelled that flight and booked another carrier departing the same time and date. At that time, I had to use their phone support, since for some reason I was just unable to cancel my flight online. I didn think much about it, but now am facing the brunt of it - their phone support staff did not bother to send me a confirmation. Every time I called I would get a different representative who would 'look into it' and ultimately do nothing. Its been over a year now and I am still awaiting my refund. On top of which i just received a random mail saying the company has no records of my cancellation and I need to provide more paperwork. Its terrible service.Since then, I have been trying to reach them - am unable to contact them via phone - havent gotten replies via mails and while their local office seemed completely clueless and unequipped to deal with any issue and prefer beating round the bush.

Asif A,"Cleveland, Ohio","I have traveled multiple times from USA to India. Everytime I have either used the airline website or Orbitz to book the airticket. Once I had to use MakeMyTrip (MMT) since I was not getting a good deal from any other sources. There were no issues when I went to India but when I was coming back I had to postpone my ticket by one week for personal reasons and I had promptly informed them about it and paid a sum of $175 toward the date change fee. And now the dram starts!!I take my flight from Kochi to Dubai which was a Jet Airways flight and since my carrier from Dubai to US is United, Jet airways staff was 'unable' to issue a boarding pass for the whole trip. I believed that and landed in Dubai airport just to find out that when I made the request for postponing the ticket, MMT staff who was handling my case 'forgot' to change the date for my segment from Dubai to Washington!!!!! Jet Airways staff said that they could not do anything and United staff was ready to issue me a ticket if I paid them an extra $250 for the getting a new ticket, hell yeah, $250 bucks fine for the mistake done by MMT staff. I was obviously not ready to do that! Then I run across the whole of Dubai airport trying to negotiate with Jet Airways and United staff whose offices are located at two extremes of the airport which was totally worthless. I was almost at the verge of breaking down and then I decided to call these idiots at MMT up and I get a reply that they can not reissue the ticket because their system is 'down' for maintenance!! (WT**) All they wanted me to do was to pay the additional $250 and they promised me that I would get my money refunded into my bank account once I reach there. Duh, as usual I trusted them.After reaching the States, I call them as the first thing and request them to refund and sent them the receipt. I also provided them with my bank account and specifically requested that I should get the whole amount in toto $250 refunded back to my bank account in the States rather than sending it to my Dad's credit card which I had used to pay the initial $175. After 2 week long wait I get a 'friendly' email from MMT saying that they have 'split' up the amount 'the way the liked it' and transferred $175 to my Dad's credit which I have no access to when I am the states and the rest $75 to bank account in states which till date (1.5 week has passed since this incident) I have not received! When I call them up to get an explanation for this and to request them redirect the amount to my account in the States since I have no access to my Dad's credit card, the following are the different explanations I got from various MMT staff during the umpteen number of times I have tried to reach them- This is your problem, not ours to deal with- This is the way we have done it and we CAN NOT change it- I don't know what you are saying, what you are saying does not make sense to me- You can do or say whatever you want, but unfortunately we can not change what we have done nowAWESOME!! I pay them thousands of dollars for an airticket out of which they get a huge commission, and they get extra money since i postponed my ticket which by mistake they 'forgot' to change completely, and then torture me with the money transfer dramaSeriously, if I am ever taking a flight in my life, ever again, I am never ever going to book with these guys after they have treated me like shi*. Also to my fellow travelers, I would recommend to stay away from these guys since they have a really bad customer service and would probably try to torture you with all the drama like what happened at the Dubai airport and like what is currently going on. I really hope that they would at least refund my 75 out of 250 to my bank account for which I am pretty sure that I will have to make another 10-15 callsGood luck with your travel guysPeace"

Please don't rely or trust on these type of agents, before doing any bookings please be clear about the cancellation policies"
Naveen P,"Bengaluru, India","This site used to be ok to use. But I think they've gone a bit rogue now. In the last couple of weeks I've tried to book two flight tickets online using my India debit card. Both times, the card was charged and later I got an email from makemytrip saying that my booking has been cancelled and my money will be refunded in 7-10 days. When I called them, they said there were no seats on the flight. The first time I thought maybe this was a one time issue and booked over the phone. They charged me more than what the online fare was after I gave them all my debit card info. The second time also they said the cancellation was becasue there were no seats on the flight (then why the heck do they display it as available online!). But this time I booked on the airline's website directly. Not only were the seats available, but I also got a better price. So my advice - use makemytrip to just find out what flights/schedules are available and then book directly through the airline's website."
pcguna,Bangalore...,"Never ever use makemytrip services for anything i booked golden quad trip through make my trip . they inturn hired the services of hliday himachal .  our holiday went for a task with the kind of services i received from the vehicle driver and because of his bad attitude . we could not cover most of our destinations . he was adamant and telling he is owning 9 cars all attached to Himachal tours .. he forced us to listen to his terms ,, our entire trip has went for a task .. following is the painful journey with the bad driver .. Day 1- 9-02 we were waiting for the call from driver in the morning 9 am .. even Himachal tour people have sent one number which i have dialed multiple time . but no one was picking up that . later on i called you and called himchal tour people . i took the correct number of the taxi driver and i spoke to him . he was telling their company had given wrong number of main .. by that time it was 11:30 . so we started our tour at 12 pm .. because of that i could able to cover only redfort / swamy narayan temple and Kutub minar ( at the closing time ) .. he forcefully took us to something called their company outlet and made us to buy .. because of delay from his end we could not cover many places on first day like ... india gate .. lotus temple ... presidents house .. and many  Day 2 -- 10-02 We started our journey from delhi to jaipur at morning 5 :15 .. but un fortunately we reached jaipur at 12 :15. He was driving the vehicle at maximum speed of 60 kms /hr . he was telling its his standard speed . at times he used to cross 70 kms /hr .. 7 hours to reach jaipur from delhi is heights of stupidity .. in between he gave break at one of his dhaba .. which was real stupid .. one single partha of the worst quality costed us 80 rs .. after seeing ambar fort he forced us to visit his showroom to purchase .. though we were loosing the time he was least bothered . by 4 :45 we could able to cover only two places. he left us near city palace at 4 :45 .. where as closing time for all the monuments are 5 pm .. because of his stupidity we could not see places like ,, hawa mahal .. couple of museums.. alberts hill .. jantar mantar etc. finally at 8 .30 pm he left us in the hotel . Though hotel address was simple and easy to find out he made us to sit in the car for more than 1 hour .. it was done purposefully . finally i got down from the car and asked the people for the directions .  Day 3 - 11- 02   since we wanted to cover most of the places like fathepur and agra We asked him to report at hotel at 8 am ..but stupid guy reported at 9 :15.. i called him more then 5 times to remind him to report early but he said its taking time to get ready . 9 :15 we took the car and requested him to show the jantar mantar .. but he asked us to pay 60 rs for the parking .. after seeing jantar mantar we left jaipur at 11 . .. purposefully he started driving slowly 60 t0 70 kms .. his intentions were clear . at 12:40 he stopped near a hotel and said he would like to take the breakfast .. we said we are loosing the time but he said we should take the food in that hotel and its his right to take a break of 1 hour in the after noon . after having lunch he started chatting with some of his friends for more then 10 mints to waste the time . during that time i called Make my trip and take the action . Unfortunately nothing has happened.... in the parking lot we had ugly and bad fight with that guy .. later on he started driving little fast .. we reached fathepur sikri at 3 pm .. guide over in fathepur sikri said it will take more then 1 hour to reach agra .. we can make a choice either fathepur sikri or taj .. so without seeing fathepur we left to agra ... we reached agra by 4 :30 and went inside the taj 5 :30.. we had literally touch and go situation to buy the tickets .. luckly because of a police officer we had 30 mints of time to see the Taj . for guide appointed by driver we paid 150 rs. later he took us to some marble showroom .. for small taj miniature we paid 500 . .. later we started our journey to Mathur .. Driver said mathura temple would be open until 10 pm .. we reached mathura by 9 :30. but fact was by 8 :30 they will lock the mathura temple .. even we could not mathura also .Day 4- From our hotel to Airport .. He had put all wet blankets in the back seat . All our dress got wet . He was telling since car was dirty he socked the back seats with the water . inspite of all this i paid him tips .  So our entire tour went for a task because of one driver and poor services by make my trip .. though i requested you to change the driver first day .. why you did not change him . he was telling he is a owner of that car + 9 other cars .. and he enforced his terms and conditions .. we missed many of our places during the tour .. we hardly got any time to see the places ..  My question is if you can not keep up your promise then why MMT is doing taxi booking. Why are you relaying on companies like Himchal tours who can not provide quality services .. Do you think this is called services ? I am highly disappointed with your services . I am really planning publish this horrible story in all the sites so that other travelers like me should not go through the same services from Make my trip  Guna +9109886288721"

Mini S,New Jersey,They are the worst people I have dealt with. They made the trip hell for my elderly parents who were travelling alone to India. The agent who booked my parents for this trip booked for them separate Internation and Domestic sectors. So when my parents took the connecting flight within India they had to pay Rs.6000/kg as domestic extra baggage fees ( which came out to almost $500 each way) .As some of you may know that travelling international you are allowed 2 bags 50lbs (23kg) each but in domestic they would allow my parents to carry only 1 bag 44lbs It is the most ridiculous thing I have heard. My parents are american citizens and for them to be able to carry international baggage till India and then pay for the rest was stupid on the part of the airlines. they lost almost $1000 over this fuss.And they had the nerve to blame my parents for this mistake that we did not consider that. and they have the worst customer service I can imagine everyone puts you on hold for almost 30 minutes minimum.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE. IF I HAD ANYTHING LESS THAN A STAR I WOULD RATE THAT

Chinthan Y,"San Jose, California","MMT has been the worst when it comes to service. Out of my 3 times of doing business, I have had bad experience for 2 times and I have decided not to do any business with them anymore.I booked for sterling resorts yercaud through MMT and when i reached the resort there was no room ready and after fighting with resort I finally got the worst room available. MMT did not help me from beggining to end inspite of repeated calls for help. After coming back when I said I would take them to consumer court, they agreed to refund me half the money through vouchers which i can use for my next booking.In second incidence, I booked Amazing Ladakh package for my parents and this time they didnt send me invoice after payment and when i called their customer care, it repeadtely got disconnect or I got rude replies or fake promises saying they will ask the person who has made my booking to call me back. They are not even ready to send my flight tickets 3-4 days before trip date or help my parents get it from some person in Delhi. Customer care person are very rude and say its none of their headache. Very unfriendly and not helpful attitude of theirs has made me decide not to do business with them ever again."

Niladri R,"Kolkata, India","I had a very exciting experience just by making online hotel booking through MakeMyTrip.com, which I would like to share with you all.I booked 3 hotel rooms at Darjeeling - Booking Date: Sun, 08 Jul '12, 00:06 hrs and I got the following message.""Kindly note, your booking is CONFIRMED and you are not required to contact the hotel or MakeMyTrip.com to reconfirm the same.""I called up hotel for some queries on 11 Jul '12, 11:00 hrs, and I was informed that they have received no reservation information from MakeMyTrip.Immediately I logged into my MakeMyTrip account and found my reservation has been promoted to WAITLISTED status, with the following details.‘There have been some changes in your existing booking. We apologize for the inconvenience and request you to give us a call at our customer service number 1-800-102-8747 to enquire about latest booking status for your booking’Note: Till now I have received any communication about this sudden reservation status change from MakeMyTrip through SMS / eMail / Phone.I called up MakeMyTrip customer care 10 times, was lucky enough to get through to an agent on 11 Jul '12, 11:30 hrs, where they kept he on hold twice (5 minutes waiting time/hold), finally the agent mentioned their was some bla bla bla which she had no clue and I will receive a call within 45minutes from another agent.I did not receive any call, and I called them again on 11 Jul '12, 19:00 hrs, this time the agent also told me that my booking will be confirmed and I will get a call within 40minutes.And you guessed right, I did not receive any call. Then on 12 Jul '12, 12:00 hrs, another agent called me for a different purpose, feedback on my customer call experience. After hearing me out; she sounded so concerned and assured me that someone will be engaged to resolve my issue.Alas!! My reservation still stays waitlisted and MakeMyTrip only assures you that they are concerned when you call them up, and asks you this question – “In a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being the lowest, where will you rank MakeMyTrip about your experience and recommend others to avail MakeMyTrip services?” :-)=: HORRIBLE MEMORIES UNLIMITED :="

samvriddhi g,gurgaon,"Makemy trip is the biggest fraud in the travel industry, specil mention to their money back gurantee. The promote hotels without doing a actual survey of the hotel. All they care is the transaction , once you have transacted you have fallen in their trap, be very sure of what they offer and what you boook never ever trust them.I will be filing a written complaint against Makemytrip for promoting hotelswithout actually verifying the hotels.The hotel Sonar Bangla is the worst place for stay and make my trip ispromoting it with a 100 % guarantee of refund.I had booked 2 rooms for 2 days, but given the situation I had tosimply find an alternate location which have resulted in unwantedexpenses in medical, transportation and alternate hotel.The hotel does not have water supply, they don't bother aboutcleanliness and hygiene. There are cockroaches and insects all overthe place.The property is isolated and poorly maintained , its more of a haunted house then a hotel.The only source of water is the rain water which is stored in the mostunhygienic condition in an open storage tank.They don't even have a proper kitchen, its filthy dirty and the foodis cooked in the same water taken from the open storage tankThey do claim that they boil the water for cooking but one has to takejust one spoon of the food the picture is clearer.4 out of 5 family members have suffered severe stomach infection, postwhich we had no choice but to look for an alternate venue.Attached are some pictures which I have taken as evidence, hope thismakes some sense for you guys.Despite the money back gurantee, make my trip refuses to acknowledge the complaint and admit the wrong for them its only money.I suggest pls do your homework before you foall for their gimicks and once you fall there is nothing like customer care its - kast se mar..."

And I am NOT an employee of MMT nor do they pay me for writing this (search for ""Dr. Pradeep Bakshi"" on LinkedIn.com to see my profile).However, I will not suggest that you do Ladakh with MMT or any other big name because they offload you to the locals. Better to use local agents in Leh.Pradeep."
udaipurmagic,"Udaipur, India",For a flight booking check the cancellation or amendment. Policy in adavance before you book with any of them.

Policy. i suffer only once when i booked Mumbai Delhi flair tickets and later flight rescheduled and paid 5000/- extra to take earlier flight of goair if there is any problem with MMT you can make a new post and MMT customer.

sun_aur_rain,USA,"I was going to my place of birth in India from the USA after 24 years. So I was very excited and planned a trip with my family and my brother's family in India many months ahead. I made reservations for 8 people on my credit card. They charged me for all 8 but left out 2 kids aged eight and ten - not sure how they expected the two kids to make and pay for their own reservations and join us later - completely ridiculous. I immediately asked for a full refund and cancellation of all tickets. The refund process was a complete nightmare - they involved exchange rate differences when tickets were booked and when money was refunded; cancellation charges etc. No one responded to my e-mails for more than 10 days. Due to time difference between the USA and India, it was difficult to get some one on the line. The few times I was able to, the person needed to talk to his manager and disappeared till the call dropped off.I would never recommend this service for people booking travel to India from outside the country. May be it works fine for people booking travel within the country. The best way is to book with the local airlines directly online, which I what I finally did without any issues. My worst online experience of booking travel and even after 7 months, I am still fighting with my credit card company for all the different charges."

Aabhas A,"New Delhi, India",Cheap Airline TicketsI have to travel regularly to different parts of India on business trips. It is due to Makemytrip that I get cheap airline tickets and hence enjoy a lot travelling around. Thanks for your services MMT. www.makemytrip.com/flights/airlines.html
Rasheed I,"Chennai, India","I used MakeMyTrip for a holiday package to a SE Asian country in Aug 2012. Once the advance (about 40%) was paid, the quality of service deteriorated. I had to make several phone calls before they would respond to any request. Emails mostly went unreplied. I had asked for passports to be collected from my residence (for visa stamping); they agreed, but later insisted that I must courier my passports to their agent. Similarly, I had requested for early transfer (from airport to hotel) instead of spending 3 hours at the airport. They agreed and then claimed I had never made the request. I found them unreliable and frustrating to deal with. they agreed, but later insisted that I must courier my passports to their agent.

Samuel An,"London, England...","I have booked a return flight to Rome from Delhi this morning. When I have receieved E-ticket in my email ==it was only showing my first name and middle name, apparently their website form did not put my surname in the E-ticket.== I called customer support and the agent told me that I must have forgotten my surname (haha) . Eventually I had to cancel the tickets after 1 hour of booking it (cost me 300/-) , now I am waiting for refund (7 working days). By the time I have my money and book it again the price will be gone up.Their online booking system is a cheat."
Trip0113,"Houston, Texas","Makemytrip.com is the worst company to do business with. Recently Booked my tickets to India calling them on a USA toll free number and paid with my USA Credit card number. Booking id US1209B00589. They are highly unprofessional. Very unethical and all their staff is trained to lie to their customersEverytime you call them, the agent will say, please send us the statement from your bank. Next time they say they want a screenshot and not a statement. Now, they have to check with other team to make sure it is a valid transaction fee.How in the world can it be a invalid transaction fee if you have the booking details with the exact fare. 3% of the fare is the foreign transaction fee. I WAS NEVER INFORMED PRIOR TO BOOKING THAT THERE WILL BE A FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEE. WHY NOT???I wish to receive my refund in next 7 business days, else i will sue them in a small claims court."
Logan L,San Francisco...,Due to reading this message board I felt comfortable booking with Makemytrip because I thought that it was a reputable travel agency in India. Unfortuantly I regret my decision as I have had the worst flight scheduling of my life due to an error on their part. It is a long complicated story so I will try and sum it up the best I can. 1) They did not explain on the ticket when I purchased it that I need to change airports for domestic travel in Mumbai. 2) The domestic ticket issued was non-valid. 3) I spent 5 hours going back and forth between domestic carriers including phone calls with this agency in order to finish my trip to my ultimate destination. Due to the poor customer service and non-valid ticket issued I would highly discourage anyone from using this booking agency.

kamala S,"Mumbai, India",I have recently taken a trip to Singapore & Malaysia thru MMT. Except for the flight booking other arrangements were good. Instead of direct flights which are available in plenty MMT opted for a flight via Colombo and during our return journey we had to wait at Colombo airport for 7 hrs 45 mns which was tiresome. Next time when I take a trip I shall make my own flying arrangement and seek the tour operators guidance only for hotel booking and local sightseeings. I had made the payments thru cheque and they never asked for my credit card details. The package was worthy of its cost and I had a very good outing.

Every time you do manage to get in contact they will promise you all your money back very soon and will string you along until you just want to give up.

Sibabrata S,Bangalore...,"Recently i booked a travel ticket from Bangalore to Coorg through makemytrip. My booking id is NH261212240736, booked in my name (Sibabrata Sahoo) on Tuesday, 18 December, 2012, 9:44 PM. The guest house i booked, that address was, Stewart Valley, Coorg, Near Vartha Bhavan, Stuart Hill Road, Madikeri,Coorg,Coorg,Karnataka,571201. The contact person for the guest house was Mr, Naveen (9900777377). The booking was for 2-days from 22 December 2012 - 24 December 2012 for 5 peoples and the money that i spend was Rs. 13,814 using my credit card.When we reached there on 22 December 2012 by 4PM and contacted Mr. Naveen, he directed to some other guest house. It was difficult for us to know the guest house name immediately because when we asked for confirmation about the name to Mr. Naveen, then he replied that you are at the back side of the house and the name board is available in front side. That is the reason we went inside of the house and few time latter we found the guest house name is Hill Valley in Mangaladevi Nagar. This was not the guest house we booked for, so we started communicating with MakeMyTrip customer care 1800 102 5506. Many times the call was disconnected and some times they replied Mr, Naveen will reach you, in next half an hour. But Mr, Naveen never came back to resolve the issue. By that time Home Valley house owner came to know about the fraud and demanded the money from us. Because we could not able to afford paying money again, so we back to bangalore on next day 23 December 2012. Before starting back to bangalore i talked again to makemytrip customer care and found they are unable to help in that emergency condition. I reached bangalore on 23 December 2012 night and on 24 December 2012, i placed a call to makemytrip to refund my paid money as well as all the lose that happened during the trip. They said they need 12 hr to resolve. For proper co-operation, i extended the time till 26 December 2012(10AM). I did not got any call back by that time, and when i called back again, i found they do not have any intention to work on it. They could not able to give me any decision about refunding my money."

Mahalakshmi R,California,"Started with Geetha Sharma, then taken outrageously by Gurjot kaur, then by Ashim Rana and then tortured by Lata Rawat, Suman and again by Geetha Sharma. Geetha Sharma was so rude that she started blaming me for no mistake of mine. Their customer service is very sluggish. This all happened for one simple flight from Chicago to Mumbai. Faded the colors of Indian Customer service. Outrageous and heinous. Genuinely do not book with them... Try Airline's website or local agencies like novatravels. They respond much better and also treat you with respect. We are customer and customers are always right even if we commit mistakes, it is their responsibility to treat us good, they are at our feet, not us. Beware of MAKEMYTRIP.

Karnikargupta,"New Delhi, India",I wouldn't recommend any one to use them . We booked a trip through them to Srilanka and iit was decided through a series of mails with their sales representative that we will be getting four star hotels and they quoted a price forit which we paid in full. Two days before our departure we got our vouchers and to our surprise their operations team had booked us in some shack calling it (luxury resort) as major part of our stay was here and the operation representative was un reachable. But after a enormous amount of phone calls finally we got to the manager who was no help. Thanks to the guide in Srilanka and his efforts with his company we were moved to a better place and he even got us upgrades. The operations and the sales team do not have any communication with each other and they show you something and finally give you something else .Caution: Make sure you get all the hotels very nicely mentioned and clearly defined before you pay as once you pay there is no hearing. We filled a complained with their grievence department and haven't heard anything concrete from them.I expect this post to be removed as with others above as it doesn't praise them.

Alfeeda I,"Bengaluru, India","HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EVER WHILE BOOKING A FLIGHT TICKET :(Booking experience was good until last time. On 14th May'13 while booking a flight ticket from JRH to BLR the amount of INR 7003 was deducted before even confirming the booking. After receiving a debit amount message on the phone the Make My Trip pops up with a screen confirming that the booking was ""Unsuccessful"". Same day while contacting the Make My Trip customer care team for the unsuccessful booking and for he debit amount refund, I was asked to provide the person details for whom the booking was made and also was informed that I will get a call back from Make My Trip which never happened till date. I was then asked to present the Bank Statement which confirms the deduction of the amount. After doing this it is almost two weeks now that there is no response from the team ""MAKE MY TRIP"". Only some unwanted ""DO NOT REPLY"" mail exchange is happening. This is the customer service level they talk about. No money is refunded till date. In fact I was again asked by the customer care team to re-present an up to date bank statement (which was already provided) and lodge a complaint at the bank. Its is a blaming game happening here between MAKE MY TRIP and bank. Almost 5-6 times MAKE MY TRIP customer care team conveyed to me to wait for 3 WORKING DAYS (72HRS) and the money will be refunded. BUT I am standing on 3rd June'13 today and there is no re-fund.Firstly, the customers patience level is being tested on a high level.Secondly, huge wastage of time by telling to wait for 3 working days (72 hrs) which looks like the customers of MAKE MY TRIP are jobless.Hopefully any concern person of MAKE MY TRIP reads this message and assist on receiving the refunded amount. Highly shameful and disappointing act by MAKE MY TRIP.Thanks."

Manjeet Nain: kindly check the flight details  me: what is the cost  Manjeet Nain: now the fare is coming 1910 usd  Manjeet Nain: only 3 seats left in this fare  me: I was given a flight from nyc to Bangalore via Dubai for usd1825. does that not exist now  Manjeet Nain: in this flight you can carry 2 PC of baggage +7 kg handbag + laptop bag  Manjeet Nain: in Emirates flight right?  me: yes  Manjeet Nain: in emirates fare is coming USD 5822  me: this is more than thrice of the original fare that was given to me yesterday?  Manjeet Nain: yes  Manjeet Nain: your departure is very close  Manjeet Nain: now  Manjeet Nain: only 2 days left  me: it cannot be true. thanks for the help  Manjeet Nain: so the fare is automatically increase  Manjeet Nain: if you will book it air india i will provide 10 USD discount  me: I can understand the fare increasing by $500 , but not by three folds over a matter of 6 hrs  Manjeet Nain: you can check on the website  Manjeet Nain: as well  Manjeet Nain: fare is increased now  Manjeet Nain: kindly advice  me: $2411.20 is the emirates website rate. are you trying to help or cheat me  Manjeet Nain: let me check  me: no need, you tried to cheat me and lost my confidence. damn it"
NellyYangthy,"Gothenburg, Sweden","I will never ever use Makemytrip, if you want to reroute the sector with the same airlines which is very much possible, it is Make my trip responsible to co-ordinate between airlines and customer. Makemytrip will not even border to look at the matter. Their customer service is the worst part if you are 3 hours jobless just to reach the right department, keep on-hold and disconnected finally than call 1-800-102 8747."

TexasTang,"Dallas, Texas","This exact same incident happened to me. I showed up at the airport only to find that our tickets had been voided (including our return flight). I quickly checked my bank account to find that the money had been debited. Then I was transferred and hung up on several times by customer service agents. When they finally refunded the money, they charged me a cancellation fee. It's absolutely disgraceful that this company still operates under the customer service policies that they deploy. Moreover, their rates are no better than any other aggregators or than booking directly through the airline's site. Use them to research fares, but DO NOT book your ticket through this organization. Worst experience ever."

ajit309,"Kota, India","this is what is wrote to makemytrip - and it had been 2 days and yet no replyTo Shivali (make my trip)Nov 8 at 5:21 PMhello Thank you for arranging our trip. But sadly it was not at all as promised. Few things that should be noted by your team members.1. Do you know what a 3 star hotel standard is? What criterias should be met before a hotel is called a three star. The hotel manager himself is telling that it is a 2 star hotel.2. Hotel silverine serves the similar menu 2 days in a row with pathetic quality of food and no options at all.3. there was no welcome drink and instead we were charged for coffee that they served (i assumed it to be a welcome drink). WOW a 3 star hotel.2. Should you consider giving a customer Innova which has already run 3 lakhs kilometers a wise decision. Realising that we have to go for 8 hrs continuous journey and 10 hrs in return trip to ambala.3. The driver is trying to make money through customers - and arguing after coming late - was it nice?So, I understand one thing now. Make my trip makes its own trip looting the customers. They are not interested in customers. huh,Ajit Agrawal"

sanjyoth,"Bengaluru, India","Hello,I had booked my honeymoon holiday package: Romantic Sojourn at The Leela, Kovalam. Though i had a great stay at Leela Kovalam but i have few disappointing feedbacks to makemytrip service offering.All my feed back is related to this site link:www.makemytrip.com/holidays/india/package… 1) In the mail i got after payment it was mentioned that all the details related to package will be sent within 3 days from the date of our arrival at leela but it was not sent till the day we started our travel to leela. Also it was sent only after i repeated started calling for the same to makemytrip toll free number. Really very disappointed.2) When i initially called the make my trip representative before booking i was told that a tour guide was included in my package and he would take us to site seeing but once we reached leela and called makemytrip we were told its not included with my package. Why the hell your representatives give wrong information to customers i dont' know :(..If it was not included i would have opted for other package but simply by wrong information from representative i booked this package and lost little more money and time. 3) In the site link: its mentioned that except for the departure date all other days had both breakfast and dinner included. But once we reached the leela hotel we were told we had only breakfast bookings. I had initially confirmed from your representatives that we had both breakfast and dinner included and he had confirmed its included in our package but seemed like its not. Soon after reaching there called to toll free number and connected to shivakumar from make my trip and he told dinner is not included :(. If its not included why do you guys include both breakfast and dinner in your site remove it and help others to choose wisely. REALLY DISAPPOINTED.4) In the hotel voucher there was nothing related to leela kovalam.I am really happy with Leela representatives and they looked after us very well but makemytrip representatives gave wrong informations, wrong deals about dinner and breakfast inclusions and no tour guide."
Deepak S,Framingham...,"BIG NO to makemytrip.No one should ever buy tickets through makemytrip. I made a mistake of buying an International ticket from them with Booking ID (IN1306B6S51413). They changed the flight details without informing us. Incidentally, I came to know about the changes while adding one more passenger to the same booking otherwise we would have missed the flight.Now, from last 5 days I have been calling customer care to issue the new e-ticket but they fail to do so. Travel is in 4 days and I don’t have the tickets. Customer care service is pathetic, they don’t have adequate information on why the tickets are not being issued. they never forward their calls to their manager.Never buy tickets from them."

Seemz41,Chicago,"Please be advised- do NOT use this company at any cost. When I went to their office to complain, and I asked them if they had any standard for customer satisfaction- the ""manager,"" Hardeep Singh Chauhan replied by saying ""Kind of""- Would you use a company who ""kind of"" wants to make their customers happy? I sure don't! On top of that, Mr. Chauhan and the rest of the Vadodara staff did not seem to care about our concerns what so ever and was even so rude by talking over me the whole time I was trying to voice my complaints! TERRIBLE COMPANY, TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!I provided them with a detailed itinerary of the cities and sites I wanted to see during my trip to India and they took away cities I wanted to see and added cities that I did not want to see. Not only did I not want to go to some of those cities, but I was made to feel unwelcome in thaose cities because I do not look Indian. I basically did their job for them by making the detailed itinerary myself and they still managed to mess it up. All they had to do was provide a driver and book the hotels and they gave us a driver that had no idea where he was going! We wasted on average 1-3 hours in between each city just because our driver didn't know where he was going- he did the best he could but the company should've provided him with a GPS."
archids i,,"I will never ever use them again. What a scam!I booked a round trip domestic flight between Madurai and Mumbai and the price was pretty much same as what I would have gotten from the airlines website directly. This is fine at first. But beware when it comes to any changes or cancellation on your itinerary. The airlines charged about Rs.1600 for cancellation. But MMT adds a whopping Rs.2000 processing fees on top of it. That too, it says as approximate amount and the actual refund is even lesser. This is an absolute scam as the actual refund will always come out lesser than the quoted amount online when you do the cancellation. If it's a matter of couple of hundred rupees on top of airline cancellation charges, it makes sense. But this is just robbery. What processing fee? Everything is computerized. This should be a percentage of airline's cancellation charges and not almost double that of.Will never ever use this website again and so should you.good luck!"
Rajesh B,"Bengaluru, India","There is no 'interesting part' of our stay, as my experience was horrible.

Though we have booked the rooms well in advance paying the total amount and showed the email confirmation about the room availability from makemytrip, they refused to provide the rooms stating they have not received any information or payment from makemytrip. They also told that there is a large amount due from makemytrrip, which forces them to reject such online bookings. We tried calling the makemytrip customer care and had to fight for about 1-2 hours to arrange a checkin. There was lot of confusion and nothing was set up properly. Finally when we checked-in, we have lost our valuable time and had to cancel our plans for the day. What we expected to be a pleasant and awesome trip with family turned out to be a terrible experience only because of the irresponsibility of makemytrip and hotel team.

Giacomo G,"Belluno, Italy","Referring to our request and contract there has been many problems.First of all we asked and pay in advance for the following journey: Palolem-Badami-Pattadakal-Hampi. Normaly toll and taxes are included in the contract: this time we had to pay INR4,700 for government taxes passing by the Karnataka. Second thing: when you ask for a precise journey, you have to pay the extra kilometers OUT of the journey, NOT the those that go out ""extimated"" ones. We were obliged to pay INR 7,000 more because we exceeded the ""extimated"" kilometrage. Extimated approximately by the garage. This policy is completely off the rules of vehicle rent. I asked with an e-mail about this policy and mr. Abhikesh Rajput (Make My Trip) gave me reassurances that we had to pay only extra kilometers OUT of the fixed journey. In that case the answer was NOT so clear. Second thing: we were 12 people, from Italy, obviously with luggages. In our first e-mails we asked precisely a Tempo Traveller or similar. We have received a 12 seats van and we travelled submerged by our luggages! It MUST be obvious that 12 tourists cannot arrive in India without luggages.Third thing: the driver had to arrive at 9.30. He arrived in Palolem at 10.40 and we departed at 11.10. Fourth: I asked the driver to do only big roads and highways. He took a country road with holes and we missed about 3 hours, so it was impossible for us to sightsee Badami in the afternoon. We had to go to Badami and Pattadakal the day after, loosing more time and extra kilometers.Fifth: the manager of the garage was unable to treat with tourists and threatened me when I asked a solution for the extra kilometers and the taxes. At the telephone was impossible to reach a gentlemen agreement. He threatened me to call police and government to push me pay. I did not received any bill for my cash payement! In any case also support was really non-existent and no clear. In a e-mail they wrote ""we tried calling you on 8866156453 however we are unable to reach you"": IT IS NOT MY NUMBER !!! This is customer care?For this reason I pretended a refund of 11,700 INR for our inconveniences: obviously no refund and reason by them side. A part from this I will not suggest to anyone else (company, travel agency or private) this agency and I will not give on internet web sites a good review about your service."

Anand G,"Raleigh, North...",MakeMyTrip customer service is terrible and unprofessional. We booked two tickets from US to India in June for travel in August 2014. Three days before our travel MakeMyTrip sends an email saying that the flight connection from Dubai to HYD is not operational. For the next 2 days we called customer service about 6 times and they claim to be working on it and ask for 24-48 hours to resolve. After 48 hours we finally escalate with customer service and they make thgeir first attempt to resolve by calling the airline United Airways. It took them 48 hours to make the first phone call !!! Our trip is less than 36 hours away and makemytrip is asking for 24-48 hours more to resolve by which tiem our flight would have left the US !!! Really senseless customer service.

Richieben,"Khajuraho, India","Hello Everyone, we had a nightmare experience 2 weeks back with a horrible serviced Travel Agency based in Bengal Kolkata called Bharat Ki Darshan. It was the worst ever experience with these uneducated cons... It is a company of few fraud and unprofessional people who just trap innocent people. If you have already booked with them then all the best but if you read the reviews and plan not to choose this company you are lucky enough... Seriously there's a team of people named Arindam, Sushant, Pooja, Varun, Shwatabdi, and Biswajit They all gave fake names however we came to know while the Tour began by tracking their phone calls among their agents.One of them would contact you to book the tour and would disappear after you pay the advance. They have a strong tie-up with Hello Travels Company and I am sure they pay local administration and antisocial as well. They would never refund if you cancel the tour and if by chance you reach the destination they would provide nothing of what is committed The hotels or car mentioned in the it entry are just a dream. None of them would meet you as a tour manager or talk to you after that. The guy who was sent in half of the Tour Varun was a BIG BIG Rascal and seemed more like a ""Dalal"" than a Tour agent. He was being controlled by another BIG Cheater named Arindam the Owner. He openly threatened all the tourist to get us killed in the destination where we were staying. It was a Religious Tour but turned into a harassment with old citizens.Tourism department should cancel the license of such companies who are sitting back and cheating their customers.. Kolkata police should take an action after so many complaints of customers and the ones who have been cheated. The good reviews about the company are just fake.. It was a nightmare to be in touch with such a co any ever..Shame on Calcutta people and Shame on Bengal. We lost around 1 Lakh 30,000 Rupees or more.After a through research with other Victims I have found the following facts for Public awarenessThe owner has multiple Facebook Profiles (All of which are Fake to cheat innocent people.https:/…https://www.facebook.com/varun.jaiswal.9400?fref=ts&amp;ref=br_tf- This one is a proffesional fraud.

Another Big Cheater and Fraud Agent-https://www.facebook.com/susanta.behera.5891?fref=ts named Susanta.He was all talk and no show, and all the 3 have to be arrested and be in Jail soon. They claim on the website that ""India's Leading Travel Organisation for Last 52 years"" I verified with Tourism department, they have no record of such a company. There is another company called Bharat Darshan a Legit one, these scumbags are just taking the Brand name and sucking people's blood. Mamata Banerjee should do something about such mean Cheaters.The interesting matter is when I was trying to look at other companies who are into cheating and Fraud games in Kolkata town, I read about one more similar reviewed company called Travels N More.https:/… Facebook Grouphttps:/…Travelsnmore.india-Facebook PageThe company is so fake that now the old website is gone and deleted. http://www.travelsnmore.com/The new one to attract innocent victims http://bharatkidarshan.com/TEAM OF CHOR, FRAUDS AND CRIMINALS."

They kept calling us back till we bought the tickets. During this process, they brought their quote down from $5100 down to $4100, making it sound like an unbelievable buy. We bought. Then they asked for additional I'd cards subsequently, taking another 3 days. After buying, we made the mistake of checking that Jet Airways was selling for $3400. Rude surprise!When doing a booking for you, they will pretend to be your best friends in travel, but even if you have the smallest of changes, they will avoid speaking with you, hang up on calls, and ignore your emails.It is a daylight robbery. They are based in the US but the office is a drop mail address only, even their CEO has a cell number. TOTAL SCAM. WE ARE REPORTING THIS TO THE US DHS AS WELL AS THEY ARE CLAIMING TO PROCESS TICKETS TO THE US LEGALLY AS A US COMPANY.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. USE KAYAK OR THE AIRLINE SITE DIRECTLY."
vinay_srt,"Surat, India","I have booked a hotel in Pahalgam(Kashmir) with my Booking ID NH210616593218 for check in 25th oct 2014 for 2 nights. But due to heavy flood in Kashmir. I was forced to cancel my trip. But makemytrip.com denied to give me refund, although they knew that the situation is not going to get improved till 25th oct. Where as all my other booking for hotels in kashmir which were booked on agoda.com gave me 100% refund for the same dates and with the same reason. But Finally writing such reviews on line and making many complains to makemytrip.com . They recently have agreed to give my refund back.. I think such forums are really helpful and we should encourage to use them."
RitasishB,"Dubai, Dubai...","I usually avoid any negative comments about any agency, but my latest experience with makemytrip compelled me to do that. It actually started with booking a holiday package for Maldives online through MMT for my family. The total trip cost was agreed as INR 2,27,580 for 2 adults + 1 child for 4 days/3 nights all inclusive package (booking quote - 140901-024785). After finalizing and mail confirmation, we transferred 50% of the money (INR 1,13,790) to their Back A/C on 10th September, 2014. From then on-wards (and for almost 3 weeks), the Makemytrip agents stopped responding back. On repeated mails and reminders they replied that they have received the money and the air tickets were issued but waiting for the hotel final confirmation. Not getting any response from them further we raised a complaint on their website and kept of following up online, calling emergency helpline no, repeated mails and also tried to contact them on their Facebook official page. All resulted in vain, so I went on escalating the complaint on regular interval till it reached the final level (the high management level - ref : 140923-050926) and still no one contacted us except some auto-replies mails. At last, got some message on Facebook (the only place where at least they were doing some minimum communications) assuring that matter is been taken care with priority and will be sorted. Just 3 days prior to your holiday, I got a call from my tour agent in the evening that now the booking is confirmed (there was no reason stated for why it took 3 weeks to do it or why no-one even bothered to call me if there was any issue) and more ridiculously he asked me to deposit the outstanding amount within that day to confirm the package as he is going for leave from the next day. However, having no options left I made the payment on that day itself. Though out Maldives tour was fine, still I cannot forget the pathetic customer service of MMT that almost ruined our vacation. On saying this, I must admit that I have been a MMT customer for quite long and had organized both domestic and international tours with them where all were fine without any glitch. But this time the extent of un-professionalism and ignorance towards customer was unbelievable. The tour agents were not only un-professional but even went to the extent of disconnecting the phone line or disconnecting the chat session on asking the reason of delay from their side. I understand that 1-2 employees of a company can have poor sense of customer service, but even a complaint raised on their website for weeks which got escalated to the higher management was still un-noticed is something makes me believe that the standard of MMT has really dropped. Hence, whoever making any plans with MMT just keep this in mind before finalizing your trip with them. No-one wants to spoil a family vacation for the un-professionalism and negligence of the tour operator. And I have noticed that any complain in TripAdvisor, they usually avoid diplomatically by a non-serious apology and a statement that they will investigate about the matter. So request to MMT, your pseudo apology does not make any difference to me. if you really want to be a top online tour operator in India, please investigate these matters (all reference is give above) seriously and take proper steps."
stevenandkay,"Sheffield, United...","makemytrip are useless robbing dogs... DO NOT USE THEM ! They took over £1600 from me via paypal for some flights, as soon as I paid they told me there had been a problem with booking & it took me ages to find out from them what the problem was... they told me that the problem could be resolved by paying another £100 or so. I said ""yes book them & I'll forward the money"" it took them ages to respond, I constantly chased them to ask if they had finalised the booking & after a few days they told me (via ridiculous e-mails) that they had cancelled my bookings. I spent ages chasing them for a refund, they told me that they had issued a refund & 2 weeks later nothing. I had to put the charge into dispute with paypal & eventually the refund has arrived… £25 short (which I bet paypal is going to tell me is down to fluctuations in the exchange rate – although I bet they’d keep the difference if it was the other way round!) ! So 3 weeks on I’ve lost £25 & I’ll bet the original flights I wanted are now fully booked… Thanks ever so much makemytrip !"

Poor or next to NO customer support.I booked one domestic round trip travel and due to their website glitch, have got myself booked on a flight with a different timing. Tried reaching their customer support to rectify, but due to their poor customer support couldn't get through to the ""concerned team"" (That's the way the first respondent refers for any type of query) even after holding on to the phone for hours and eventually have to cancel the booking with all the cancellation charges.Its so unfortunate that we use their services at times of emergency and there's nobody to respond to answer your queries."
Arundhati P,"London, United...",Absolutely awful customer service. Kept waiting on the phone for over 2 hours to deal with a simple request. No call back and no semblance of any attempt to help. Thrown from pillar to post by several departments with nobody willing to take any responsibility or ownership of the issue raised which would have been simple enough to resolve. Book directly through the airline if you can.

Shipra J,,"I am sharing you my feedback on my experience with Make my trip which is supposed to be a number one travel brand. I went to Dubai with my family and my first and last experience with this agency was just worst. Jotting down some highlights of your services:1) Highly embarrassed when the Taj hotel people refused to gave us room as they had not received the payment. Though we have already paid the Make my trip full payment 15 days early. We waited around 2 hours, but no representative has arrived to sort out this issue. So at last my husband handed his credit card as a security to the hotel people for the payment. it was only after that we were issued the rooms. 2) We were told that a Make my trip representative will be waiting for us with our name tag at the Airport. There was no one at the airport with our name tag. we found a make my trip counter and they told us that they cant help us since the booking were done through Lama Tours, I had to go inside the airport to locate the Lama representative. 3) Before the trip started we had highlighted that there was very little time gap between our Bhurj Khalifa visit and Dhow Cruise dinner. We were given an assurance that we will get sufficient time at the Bhurj Khalifa, however we were given only 1 hr(effectively only 30 minute due to long distance from parking to the entrance, we had to run all the way to visit the place.  4) In our mails, we have clearly mentioned the tour for big bus which was full day. Still these people booked some 4 hours tour instead of the big bus passes. So we had to do lot of follow up for getting these passes. 5) Even before going to this trip, there was a major delay in their services. After multiple follow ups we were shared the vouchers only 2 days before the departure date. While I was informed that the vouchers will be issued within 48 hrs of the final payment, it took MMT a week to release the vouchers. There were multiple instances when we had to follow up with the team without any response from Make my trip. I had travelled on multiple international holidays, however my experience with MMT was pathetic. It only shows that a big brand does not ensure good service. I will never use make my trip and will definitely share the same feedback with all our known people."

sidu,Bombay,"I have faced the same problem with this company twice so far. The agents at makemytrip.com have a habit of misguiding you regarding luggage allowances / meal options and they end up overcharging you. After making the payment they expect you to furnish an invoice from the airline which is ridiculous since you have made the payment to MMT and not the airline. Airline will refuse to give you an invoice stating that the e-tkt has the fare break-up. Thereafter they will promise action in 24/48/72 hours and if you are lucky, you'll have to follow-up only about 10 times!! Therafter, they will take 5 working days to give you a refund. So you end up spending more than 4-5 hours of calling, atleast 4 e-mails and a whole lot of stress! So I'd suggest all to avoid www.makemytrip.com and make the booking for other web-sites mentioned in the posts above."

piyush711,"Mumbai, India","I was planning a vacation with family and it was almost at the last moment I was making flight bookings through MakeMyTrip at about 2 at night. There were in all 3 tickets which I wanted to book and I though of making the booking one by one. First I booked the ticket in my name, Second I booked the ticket in my Wifes name. But to my surprise when I saw the ticket copy over my email immediately after booking, it was shown my name in the name of passenger. Just at the same time when I was making the 3rd booking in my sons name and just before payment the website gave me an alert saying I already have the booking in the same name, and then I realised that such alert never popped up when I was making the 2nd booking, and because of some technical error it was again and again selecting the same name for booking inspite of me selecting different name.Immediately when I called up the customer care, on listening to my issue they replied we cannot do any thing at the moment and you need to book a fresh ticket and cancel this ticket. Also the refund that I was eligible on this ticket was only about Rs.780 and around Rs. 10500 will get deducted as cancellation charges of airlines and makemytrip.If the customer service guy wanted they could have easily resolved the said issue and this 10500 could have been saved, but no was interested in resolving.Since that day onwards till date I have been writing emailed to them and requesting them to call me and understand what and how things went wrong, but till date no one is bothered to give me a call back and just refused to refund my full amount, inspite of the fact that the wrong booking happened because of technical ERROR IN THE WEBSITE.This kind of attitude of a Travel Portal clearly shows that they are just not bothered about what customer has to go through.They are just not interested in even taking an effort to resolve customer issues as they know customer will not do any thing wrong to them for such a small amount.I suggest everyone reading this should just stop using this website and every one known should also be told not to use this website.Also one every important thing I came to know is, when you book the flight tickets through this website you don't get full milage point and it is almost like 50% of what you would get if you book through direct website of the airlines."

Effaa41,"Chennai, India","HI thereI had recently booked my return ticket from Chennai to Manilla through make my trip...Due to change in the business plan there I wanted to change the booking and it was the mosthorrifying and bad experience I have ever had through any online booking.My return was booked in 19th July 2015 from manila to chennai and I wanted to change it to the 14 th or 15 th of July.The online system in make my trip does not allow travellers to modify online and expects the customer to call an Indian call centre no that is not toll free for international callers. So called the customer care 16 times and every time I was put on hold for an average of 8 minutes and then it would either get disconnected or they would say server is down and asked me to call after 2 hours..The longest was 28 minutes with the executive saying he would like to verify so many thigns and would take 5 to 6 minutes every time..... The local time there was after 1 AM.. Please bear in mind all were international ISD calls.They said they have made changes and none of the call centre executives told me that I have to call them using an ISD call as my registered Idian number was different and pay the fare difference payment at the same time the ISD call is being made.. So inspite of calling so many times and wasting 200 USD only for ISD calls the change was not affected. Finally the 16 th call I made was fruitful as it was that customer care guy who told me that I cannot make any changes or make online payment through mobile phone and I must have a desk top system and also be connected over phone parallely ..... Travelled half an hour in the middle of the night in manilla to find a browsing centre and called this guy and made the extra payment to effect the date change. The fare difference was about Rs 16000 and the money spent on calls was more than Rs 13000 and ended up spending close to rs 30000 to change a Rs 29000 malaysian arilines ticket. I throught of contacting the local malaysian arilines office and I was advised by make my trip staff not to do so as I would incur a charge of 1000 USD if I were to go directly and make the change as make my trip has better negotiated rates....Later I found out that I was foolish to have taken that verbatim as the charges with the airlines were almost the same.......Make my trip should give priority queue for Indian customers making an ISD call from outside India and the executives must give a proper reply so that people dont waste money.Would have avoided all this had I booked directly with Air asia or malaysin airlines and it would have worked out much cheaper an easier as most of these airlines have a local office and would have been easier to have changed it in person there.Well I have clearly learnt that business travellers who might have change in itenary should never book through sites like make my trip.com to have piece of mind and save expenses.....Would certainly like to post this message on all travel forums, trip advisor and blog sites so that Indian people understand the real problems associated with make my trip.Thanks and regardsEffaa"

Ajit Pal s,,"This is a fraud company with unprofessional and unethical people working for it. I wanted to change the flight therefore asked them if the ticket can be refunded and cancelled. Their team member, said that he could cancel the ticket and process the refund of INR60,000. I asked him to go ahead. After five minutes he sent me the below message""Abujam Sanjoy Singh <Abujam.Singh@makemytrip.com, Jul 9 (8 days ago)Dear Customer,Your ticket is cancelled but according to fare rule your ticket is non refundable for one passengerReally apologise for the inconvinience.""They cancelled my ticket and refunded only INR 5000 which is nowhere near INR60,000.

Smita D,,"I had booked my tickets from Jaipur to Guwahati via Delhi and the return tickets too via Make My Trip (MMT) on 31-Aug-2015. There were two bookings for each trip amounting to a total of Rs. 17509 (Rs. 9779 and Rs. 7730 for the respective trips).On the home page of MMT, when I looked for the e-tickets, I found that the amount of my return trip was shown as only Rs. 2100 instead of Rs. 7730. I had contacted the concerned airline who had clarified what the correct amount was and had sent me the correct break-down of the fare and the receipts for each sector of the booking. When I expected the same from MMT, the Executive ARCHIT KAJLA shared a mere Word Document with the amount mentioned. I believe this can be easily done by anyone! It did not even have the electronic sign of MMT. Another Executive SUCHETA VERMA had sent a PDF on my request but this too did not seem authentic. The amount was never updated in the portal. They said that they could not update it due to a technical glitch!This would have its consequences later.1. I could not get the Reward Points that I should be entitled to concerning the amount of money that I had booked the tickets for.2. I could not cancel my tickets as the refund amount was much less than the actual amount.I had made several calls to MMT to get the amount updated but nothing was done for it. Even the mails addressed to the top management were not answered. I raised a complaint too along with copies of my bank statement and the receipts shared by the concerned airline. But no reason or proof could survive against the ‘TECHNICAL GLITCH’ of MMT!I had called MMT expecting that they would be able to rectify the issue.1. Call 1 (Executive – RAHUL) on 03-Sep-2015I had a conversation with RAHUL regarding the same issue. He said that he could provide me the invoice for my booking. I mentioned that I already had several copies of the invoice both from the airline and MMT. I wanted it to be updated in the portal. When he could not provide an acceptable solution, I wanted to cancel the booking. He said either of the sectors are non-refundable although I had confirmed from the airline earlier that the booking was refundable, which I had also noted at the time of booking.He was not able to sort any of the issues which I had raised. I wanted him to connect me to the FLOOR SUPERVISOR. He was so concerned about his performance being poor that he kept my call on MUTE instead of HOLD for several minutes. When he connected back, he mentioned that his FLOOR SUPERVISOR was busy and would arrange for a call back. When my emails were not answered to, how could I expect that a call back would be arranged? I said that I would wait for any length of time required but I wanted to communicate to the FLOOR SUPERVISOR the same day instead of waiting for the call back. I also requested him to keep the call on HOLD instead of MUTE. He kept the call on HOLD this time until he connected again saying that his FLOOR SUPERVISOR was busy again. I agreed to wait again. This time he again kept the call on MUTE and DISCONNECTED within few seconds.2. Call 2 (Executive – GAURAV) on 03-Sep-2015I called again the same day. This time I got connected to GAURAV. I had to explain the entire scenario to him. But even he did not connect the call to the FLOOR SUPERVISOR quoting the same reason. He, too, followed the same protocol of MUTE-HOLD-MUTE until he disconnected the call.3. Call 3 (Executive – MONI MISHRA)Some days later, when I did not get any call or email from MMT regarding my concern, I called again. MONI MISHRA answered my queries satisfactorily and also clarified the correct amounts which I would get on cancellation. I went ahead with her suggestions and cancelled my tickets on 06-Sep-2015, expecting a refund would be made by 15-Sep-2015.I also called the concerned airline to verify the amount. They confirmed that the amounts were almost similar if not exactly the same. But upon cancellation, the refund amount for the second trip was only Rs. 788 when I had booked the tickets for Rs. 7730!I had raised a claim for the same to ensure that the correct amount is refunded. But the portal did not show any claim number by which I could track the status of the claim! Neither any Executive provided me the claim number on call. I called once again for this.4. Call 4 (Executive – CHANCHAL SHARMA) on 08-Sep-2015CHANCHAL SHARMA accepted that the amount which I have claimed would be refunded to me within 8 working days (5 working days for MMT and 3 working days for the Bank). I accepted the same and ended the call.There was no response from MMT either through email, message or call regarding the refund till 15-Sep-2015. When the refund was not processed with the time promised to me, I called the Bank. They mentioned that they have not received any transfer from MMT. I called the airline again but they mentioned that they had already transferred the amount to MMT on the same day when I had cancelled the tickets!Now, I had to ask MMT for the delay. On the same day, I had called again.5. Call 5 (Executive - LALIT) on 15-Sep-2015LALIT answered me his time. I had to explain the whole scenario to him who assured that the refund would be done by 18-Sep-2015. When I asked LALIT about the delay, he said that he does not know why the refund had not been transferred!! Then he added the omnipresent reason of TECHNICAL GLITCH behind the delay! I now believe that MMT does not employ technically-sound professionals to solve the perennial TECHNICAL GLITCH! I rated LALIT 1 on a scale of 4.Yet again, the refund was not made on 19-Sep-2015 as expected. I had to contact MMT.6. Call 6 (Exucutive - SUSHOBHIT) on 19-Sep-2015The Executive named SUSHOBHIT said that the refund is initiated by not yet transferred to my account due to some TECHNICAL GLITCH. He asked me to wait for four more working days during which my claim would be reviewed and refunded by 22-Sep-2015. He assured that the issue will be completely solved by 22-Sep-2015 without fail! SUSHOBHIT also mentioned that he would raise my concern under HIGH PRIORITY to his superiors so that the refund is processed at the earliest. When I asked him to send an email confirming all the conversation that we had, he simply denied that he could not do so. On asking about contacting him on the same issue, he provided me his extension number on which I could contact him. I had none of my queries resolved, so I rated him 1 on a scale of 4.Having received no communication or refund from MMT, I contacted them again on 22-Sep-2015. I tried to connect to the extension number that SUSHOBHIT had provided me earlier. But as expected after all the encounters with MMT, the extension number turned out to be invalid!! I called again.7. Call 7 (Executive - ALOK) on 22-Sep-2015ALOK was on call this time. As expected and known, he again asked me to wait till 26-Sep-2015 to get all the refunds transferred. He also made the revelation that SUSHOBHIT had never raised my concern as a HIGH PRIORITY. He had not raised any complaint at all. Moreover, he had mentioned the waiting time as seven working days whereas; he had mentioned four to me. I believe that ALOK raised the concern to his superiors and assured that the refund would be done by 26-Sep-2015.On the same evening I got a call from MMT asking me to clarify why I had rated their esteemed Executive 1 out of a scale of 4. MMT could never arrange a call back in spite of assuring me that they would contact me for solving my concerns but they could undoubtedly contact me asking for my clarification. I assume that my explanation had convinced them. Had a 0 been available on the scale, I would have rated a 0 instead of rating him even a 1! The 0 is not only for the agent but for the entire management of MMT.After waiting for 3 weeks instead of only 1 and going through the ordeal without having the refund yet, I am more than convinced now of the promises that MMT makes to the customers are only for their own benefit!Does MMT have no mechanism in place to keep a track of all the pending requests and solve them on time?Does MMT have no SLA to follow or any management to guide them?Does the Floor Manager never train the Executives on how to talk with customers, forget about solving their problems? The MUTE-HOLD-MUTE-DISCONNECT policy is never noted by them?Does the Quality Management team never monitor the calls that are being handled?And don’t forget to honour the Technical Team who can neither find the reason behind nor solve the eternal technical glitch!!I now doubt how do they proclaim themselves to be India’s No 1 Travel Site?From Smitamesmita95@gmail.com"

C_1970,"New Delhi, India",They have the worst customer service you can imagine. It's a bunch of uneducated people who answer your call and that is if you are able to reach them in the first place. It is impossible to reach the same person if you are trying to follow up on an issue. They will give you their extension number. However when you try to dial it - the message you get is that the extension number does not exist. You can try it for any extension number and you get the same message. However the customer service agents have no shame in sharing their extension number and the same applies for people at higher levels. This would have amounted to cheating if they were in a western country.In case you are looking for a refund you are completely at their mercy. They have no problem by passing their set time limits for the refund. It took me almost a month and tens of phone calls to get mine. I had to finally threaten with a consumer court complaint before they processed it.Do not go to them if you are looking for a professional service. They take the money in advance in most cases and their system is designed in such a way that you can not do much if they do not meet their commitment. So guys it is not about a deal they give you.
