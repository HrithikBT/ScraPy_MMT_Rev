"Ranajn of Other, Other"," Aug. 22, 2019","Hi. I just to brief my experience with MakeMyTrip.com. Just few months back I have to travel on urgent basis to Lucknow. I just started searching for Flight ticket to Lucknow from Dehradun for very next day. After searching various travelling agency portal, I got best price from MakeMyTrip.com around Rs 2500. Their customer support was good. Definitely I will recommend MakeMyTrip TO OTHERS. Ranjan"
"Vishal of Ahmedabad, Other"," June 10, 2019","Hi! I am Vishal **, A Research Scientist and Anesthesiologist. I want to share my memorable experience with MakeMyTrip and would love to recommend people for the same. The flight tickets were so cheap other than any other websites and tremendous so friendly support from Customer care. I had missed my flight due to visa issues and I was traveling to South Korea in a Very important International Conference. I missed the flight and the next flights were so costly to purchase around 1 lakh and more. The airlines were suspended my tickets and it was also non-refundable. I was stuck at Delhi Airport!"
"nishith of Other, Other"," June 7, 2019","I had planned a trip on 7 June to a resort for two days (9 June to 11 June). During my booking by mistake I put 1 day prior to actual departure (8 June to 10 June). I called the hotel but they refused to help as the booking was online. Now since the booking was one day before, cancellation and modification option was already gone. I emailed the customer care but according to rules it was showing extra charges (same cost of two days again). Then I called the customer care number on the booking voucher, they talked to the hotel and changed the dates accordingly, mailing me the new voucher. The process was easy and smooth. I was so afraid that I have screwed up, but the guy on the phone really helped me. Thanks Suravjeet!"
Preeti of India," Feb. 15, 2019",I was awestruck by their concern and service. We had made a booking via Make My Trip for our Vizag tour. However our hotel cancelled our booking within hours of our reaching. But MMT team helped us throughout and made another booking within 1 hour time and that too in one of the best hotels in Vizag. We are very happy with the MMT service.
"Ayushi of India, Other"," Jan. 19, 2019","Perfect place for stay in Mussoorie. Beautiful construction and location. Soft spoken and cooperative staff. Clean and well-maintained rooms and hygienic and clean washrooms. Food is tasty. Overall stay is great. Would love to stay here on my next visit. For people searching for cleanliness in a hotel stay, this is the right place."
"Sonal of Delhi, Other"," Aug. 30, 2019","MakeMyTrip your 24 hour support services is a big time failure. When the customer calls for a complaint you put us on hold for like 30 min saying that it is been routed to concerned person and every time the person needs next 24 hrs to find a solution. Today after 5 days, still the issue is not resolved and the concerned person appointed who is the SUPERVISOR is now not coming on calls even after reminder mails to him. To add to this, your customer support team has no understanding and knowledge of how to handle such requests."
"Elyas of Dubai, Other"," Aug. 26, 2019",Stay away from makemytrip as they charged me more than what was shown on the screen and would not admit their mistake. They have fraudulently charged me extra for flights that I did not agree to. They charged 7% higher than the actual display amount!
"Kabir of Varanasi, Other"," Aug. 26, 2019",My booking Id **. This is worst tour Co. as they charged as per discussion but failed the commitments made as after reaching destination they denied for many things mentioned in their itineraries and wasted my money and ruined trip and not responded contact. Ram ** choose MMT agency for the best trip and can enjoy my trip without any intention of getting the thing arranged and managing my trip but I felt it was the worst trip of my life as per personally I could have planned much better trip by myself. So I will write in points whatever I had issues with the trip:-
"Joe of Fredericton, NB"," Aug. 21, 2019","I would've put No stars. I will never book their online booking again, if you want to make any changes it's a nightmare. The support phones will never be answered. Please stay away from this website. The deals are also not good. I had to finally cancel my booking and pay cancellation charges. Worst experience ever. PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COST."
"Jaideep of Oakland, CA"," Aug. 20, 2019","MakeMyTrip automatically adds extra charges to your booking WITHOUT CONSUMER CONSENT. The consumer only gets to know of these charges AFTER their credit card is charged. By which time it is too late to cancel, because those charges are NON-REFUNDABLE. THIS IS FRAUD. Always better to book airline tickets DIRECTLY from the airline website."
"Anuradha of Houston, TX"," Aug. 18, 2019","Do not use MakeMyTrip for train reservation. Even if your reservation does not get confirmed, you will not be able to cancel and you will not get your money back. MakeMyTrip.com steals your money. Indian railway will return your full fare but MakeMyTrip steals it."
"Ajit of Kolkata, Other"," Aug. 15, 2019","The biggest mistake I made for this trip was to book a package through MakeMyTrip.com. I have been a loyal MakeMyTrip customer for more than 15 years. This led me to make a package tour booking from your organization. After my trip, I can safely say this was the worst mistake of my life. With your kind of incompetent customer care, you can very well call my trip as SpoilMyTrip.com. "
"Dipakkumar of Other, Other"," Aug. 14, 2019","My self Dipak **, Yesterday night i.e 13th Aug, 2019 I booked 1 room at Meera Hotel, Mount Abu, Rajasthan from MakeMyTrip website and I also done online payment. After my booking I called the Hotel manager on number (9414201829) which is given on my Booking receipt for just to confirm my booking, but He replied that they are not booking rooms online by any website whether it is MakeMyTrip or Goibibo etc.. Further I told him that, ""then why your hotel is showing in MakeMyTrip website and also I got your number from the booking receipt."" I also told him to refund my money which is INR 5292/- for 3 nights (15th Aug to 17th Aug). My checkout date is 18th Aug. On this he replied that, ''You can take your refund from Makemytrip, I am not responsible for this refund."""
"Jyoti of Jayanagar, Other"," Aug. 12, 2019","You cannot rely on MMT for Visa. Before applying for my Singapore Visa, I inquired for the time it will take for getting Visa as I needed to travel to another country. They assured me that if I apply on 24th Jul, I will get my Visa by 5th Aug. I applied for Visa on 24th Jul and it's been three weeks since then and I haven't received it. They requested unnecessary documents and kept my Visa application on hold. Whenever I keep calling them, they would say that it will come in a week! The application shows that my Visa application is cancelled. The Singapore Visa department is horrible. Very bad customer service."
"Nikhil of Woodinville, WA"," Aug. 12, 2019","I made a flight booking for wrong date on MakeMyTrip.com. Realized my mistake within minutes and immediately called them to change the dates. MakeMyTrip 1-800 customer care does not connect from USA. Landline has IVR that would not take my US phone number for existing booking. Chat bot sucks. They responded on Twitter and Facebook promising to contact me asap. After 10 hours of anxiety and wait I finally reached the airline directly and they helped by cancelling the itinerary with FULL REFUND. If more time had passed, the airline would not allow any refunds for cancellation after 24 Hour window."
"Ravi of Other, Other"," Aug. 11, 2019",MakeMyTrip is very poor in customer service as well as they always try to cheat you. When you book ticket and want to cancel it They don't provide any help. Their customer service is pathetic. I will suggest to not to use it.
"MEET of MADHAPAR, Other"," Aug. 11, 2019","Please note I had made booking in Pachmarhi for 10th and 11th 2 room. Due to heavy rain I had cancelled my plan on 9th and contacted customer care number on 9th but MakeMyTrip is not responding at all. They are just delaying the matter and on 10th I had received call from hotel stating that, ""MakeMyTrip has not cancelled or extended your booking so we cannot do anything in this case."" I have paid full amount of rs. 7100 in advance and the money has gone totally I think. This is just how MakeMyTrip is creating big money off customers."
"Gayathri of Madurai, Other"," Aug. 11, 2019","Hi... I am a solo traveler and booked my trip to Nepal. The hotel that was recommended as part of package wasn't good and few of my friends who visited gave a negative feedback. I contacted the agent to change the hotel and was following for 2 days, it didn't get resolved. I am really upset and doesn't have an option to cancel as it's told to me that package is totally non-refundable."
"Kapil of Gwalior, Other"," Aug. 9, 2019","I would like to share my experience for my recently hotel booking in Bhopal. Hotel name is RnB Bhopal. I booked the rooms through MMT. Rooms were small, stinking of stale smoke and musty odour of wood and paint. The walls were damp with peeling paint. Floors were dirty with equally dirty foot mat. The linen was dirty, yellowed and the towels were of poor quality. The bathroom was small, and had poor hygiene, with broken accessories I would not recommend for families. Picture shown on site does not match with actual property. I have pictures as a proof. Would not suggest to use MakeMyTrip. Better user Goibibo.."
"Muthu of Other, Other"," Aug. 8, 2019","We booked a hotel booking in MakeMyTrip website but hotel denied entry and told me they don’t accept MMT CUSTOMER. ME WITH MY WIFE, 2 year son and 6 year daughter were just standing in road. We called customer care people. Nobody gave adequate information and refused to do alternate hotel. 4 hours we suffered calling them because but no reply. Long call waiting. Never ever again with MAKEMYTRIP. IT'S COMPLETE WASTE AND FRAUD. STRICT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST MAKEMYTRIP...."
"Manisha of Delhi, Other"," Aug. 2, 2019",They are sitting only for money sake. Their services are below poor. They don't value their customers. We were 3 families and took 3 rooms for 2 days still they had no value for customer. Will never suggest anybody to try this hotel ever..Poor staff. They need training on how to treat customers otherwise they will shut down soon..
"Nishi of Pune, Other"," July 31, 2019","BOOKING ID: **. We were a group of four girls and had booked a suite room in Citrus Chambers, Mahabaleshwar from 27/07/2019 to 28/07/2019, for four people through MAKE MY TRIP ONLINE PORTAL. While booking, we had specially written that the room should be for four people and pictures of two different rooms with different bed sheets and slightly different interiors in a single suite were shown to us on the MMT site. Accordingly believing that the suite room is with two bedrooms we booked the said suite for four people for a rate of Rs 14000 per night. "
"Mukesh of Nagpur, Other"," July 28, 2019",This is fraud app and don’t have proper customer care service..Customer care is **. They just provide wrong information to you. Even mmt shows that guest are allowed. Hotel will deny check-in. I paid 1300inr to go from station to Hotel Unity for return trip which was waste. MMT misguide and don’t have solution in hand. I was waiting for call for three hours and resolution got after 6 hours..not even alternate hotel. I got refund so after taking 1500inr refund I had to pay 3500 at one hotel.
"Lalit of Narwana, Other"," July 28, 2019","My friend and I planned our weekend trip in outskirts of Delhi on 27 July to 28 July on MakeMyTrip app. While searching on MakeMy Trip I applied filter of resort and swimming pool, got some options and checked amenity of swimming pool. I selected resort Ashok Country Resort, 30, Rajokri Road, Kapas Hera, New Delhi, in which amenity of swimming pool was shown on MMT App. I booked Ashok Country Resort and checking in said hotel on 27/07/19 at around 6:45 pm on pay at hotel option. "
"Elsa of Bangalore, Other"," July 27, 2019",I am a student travelling for the first time to USA and I booked a flight via MakeMyTrip to Detroit. I booked the flight about 2 months early. The flight was scheduled to take off in Bangalore with layovers at Abu Dhabi and Rome. The flight was operated by Etihad till Abu Dhabi and by Delta Air Lines till Detroit. MakeMyTrip DID NOT INFORM ME of any transit visa that may be required. After about 1 month I was told by a friend that on calling Etihad Airways she was informed that since Etihad and Delta have no baggage agreement I will have to re-check in my baggage at Rome. Due to this I would require a transit visa.
"Nirmal of Mumbai, Other"," July 26, 2019","Booking is easy but updated information regarding agents are not available from MMT. No one take follow up from mmt or agent site. Tracking team is not working properly, due to this customer always suffer on online booking, especially bus booking on mmt. Customer care is very bad experience for me. They not give proper response. They also not known about case resolve situations. Only say ""I raise your complain"". But not any notification or complain no raise by them. My money is already paid but this will be recover or not, I don't know. I take effort for my own money. This is very painful."
"Bobby of Halifax, NS"," July 25, 2019","If you are abroad and need to contact them for anything whatsoever, don't even try. There is no way you can contact them, all emails bounce back, you cannot chat with them unless you have an Indian tel number. I managed to contact them on the phone once (after numerous attempts), got through to one chap who says he cannot help and to email them on supportz@makemytrip.com. Did that, immediately bounced back. Tried various other email IDs I could find on the internet but all bounced back! I have given up on trying to cancel and get a refund of my multiple domestic tickets (family of four) and will swallow the loss. Never again - MAKEMYTRIP!"
"Divya of Westfield, IN"," July 18, 2019","I booked railway tickets from MakeMyTrip but they were on wait list for quite some time. I decided to cancel the tickets since I made alternate arrangements. We needed confirmed tickets. When I went to the MakeMyTrip website, there is no option available for customers to cancel railway tickets booked from their website!! I called the listed customer service number twice: ** - and both times I was on hold for over 30 mins and no one came to the phone! There is no email id, no chat session - nothing available from the USA version of the website. Same thing on the India version of the website. I am yet to find out how to get these tickets cancelled, no clue so far. I am stuck with these tickets."
"Abhishek of Mississauga, ON"," July 18, 2019","I had written a review detailing my stay with the hotel. MakeMyTrip took over 1 month to publish the review. They took out whatever they wanted and only allowed what was mutually beneficial to the hotel and the booking agent - MakeMyTrip. However, the Hotel replied to my review and directly insulted my female guest by stating she was an unsocial guest! In other words, my to be wife is now a prostitute to the opinion of this hotel! Why is it that the business partner (Hotel) of MakeMyTrip, gets to state whatever they want in their response to prevent embarrassment from factual events? But a customer is not allowed to state the facts so other consumers are aware of the issue. Consumers should have the right to give honest feedback."
"Affreen of Other, Other"," July 16, 2019","I booked for Ladakh Holiday package of 6N/7D on Jul 8, 2019 and made the payment of Rs, 10,000 on the same day. Then immediately realized that I cannot go on the said dates as there was something else which came up. I immediately called-up MakeMyTrip and asked them to cancel the trip, to be precise asked to cancel the trip on Jul 9, 2017 and asked for refund. They denied any refund stating as per policy any initial partial payment is non-refundable. I requested them as I have asked for cancellation the very next day after the payment and they would not have done any kind of arrangement for my travel in those 24hrs (I did not get any flight ticket booking as proof of their booking my travel). Still they denied any refund saying as per policy they cannot refund the Rs. 10,000."
"Kapil of Delhi, Other"," April 22, 2019",Hello Friends. I am Kapil & I am sharing a my experienced with MakeMyTrip. MakeMyTrip is a Fraud Company. They have no value of words. All Management are so irresponsible and faked. According to me don't use MakeMyTrip for any travels because there are loot Money and given by bad service.
"Krishna of Pune, Other"," April 21, 2019","I have booked ticket through guest user, after successful payment I have not received ticket details on 3rd April with travelling date of 15th and 18th April. After 2 days I contact customer care, they were not able to find any transaction with details of mail, contact no., traveller name, secondary mail. Customer care executive was unable to find any ticket details throughout week. (All conversation on Call and some of on mail). One of executive told that, ""Sir ticket is not cleared. MMT has initiated refund on 5th April."" So checked with bank, but bank has denied. Send statement to MMT for cross check. I have sent mail on 14th, 16th & 18th April. Send mail to MMT for refund status."
"Biswajeet of Chandapura, Other"," April 19, 2019","Would like to show a classic case how MMT (MakeMyTrip) cheats consumers? Here's a case - if you're in a hurry for a Tourist VISA & book an international flight via MakeMyTrip, you'll go for a Travel Insurance like in Schengen countries it's mandatory. Interestingly their same ""Apollo Munich"" company insurance for domestic sectors has ""trip delay & cancellation"" + much more clauses than mere 11 clauses in International segment but they charge you a real high premium (straight double premium than their rivals/partners, compare before you go for them) for a small sum-assured in the latter segment. They don't even share the plan with you. Seemingly in most cases, flights get delayed in International Segment which they have not smartly covered as a clause where in you should be eligible to claim."
"Yaseen of Dubai, OTHER"," April 19, 2019","Hello all. Please do not waste your valuable time and money to make any booking on MakeMyTrip. The company has ZERO customer service. No one replies to emails, management emails bouncing back. Chat is like graveyard, and you are trying to chat with dead people. I have very bad experience and I lost my money. So please don't waste your time and money."
"Aman of Delhi, Other"," April 19, 2019","I booked this hotel through MakeMyTrip. Hotel name was ONE HOTELS IN CORBETT. I made full payment in advance for 2 cottages. However, on reaching the hotel I was shocked to see the pathetic condition. SEEPAGE ALL OVER IN THE ROOMS and dining area. Undergarments hanging in the balcony. We were 2 families with kids so decided not to stay there and stayed in some other hotel. I want full refund of my booking as the quality of the service provided by MMT is not up to the mark."
"Nisha of Raipur, Other"," April 18, 2019",I will summarize the worst experience of the hotel 'The Rink Pavallion' Mussorie in following points.
"Akriti of Mumbai, Other"," April 18, 2019","Hi, I booked a hotel in Trivandrum and was denied check in because the hotel did not receive that amount. It was 11pm in the night and I was travelling alone. I had a early morning flight from here and from 8:30 pm I was waiting for the customer care to get back to me. I made 5 calls to them all with the promise of getting a call back from them within 15 mins. Forget a call back each time. The executive on the phone was apologetic and very prompt in transferring my call and that is all I got from them. I am a woman and the treatment from MMT I got was just not correct. My constant tweets or phone calls none got them to respond. Don't know how MNC can treat their customers this way. #frustrated and #helpless. Regards, Akriti."
"Ashwini of Other, Other"," April 18, 2019","Hello Team, I made a booking with MakeMyTrip. Paid 90 pounds per day for hotel in London. The images shown very fake of the rooms. MakeMyTrip is not reliable. And fake. I will suggest all my family members and friend not to book with MMT."
"Veeraj of Other, Other"," April 17, 2019","I was trying to book a flight ticket through MakeMyTrip app and it threw an error in the last screen. It happened twice so I switched to a different app and booked my ticket. To my surprise, I got an email from MakeMyTrip saying my booking is confirmed. I got shocked because app had failed and I never entered the OTP for credit card transaction. When I called MMT support, they said transaction is successful. When I asked them how, they said since I had the card information saved in the app it pulled the money directly from there without asking me for any OTP. They hung up the call saying that. When I tried to call their support again, I found that they had blocked me from calling them through their IVR system. I can't reach their support at all now. Fraudulently they sucked money from my credit card and now I have no one to complain."
"S of Bengaluru, Other"," April 15, 2019",We had a horrible experience with the outstation cab we booked through MMT. I am writing this so that other can also learn a lesson. First of all the driver sent by MMT was just 19 years old without any commercial driver license (which we got to know later during the trip) and we were going to Ooty where an expert driver can drive. We realized later that if any accident would have happened who would have taken the responsibility. Second the driver pretended he did understand Hindi nor English no even the word “stop.” Second day we hear him speaking Hindi nicely so he was lying. He did a lot of other annoying things that we ignored. 
"Bhavik of Anand, Other"," April 13, 2019","I have booked 2 rooms in one of the resort from MMT app. I have booked room after I saw room pics in MMT app. However, when I arrived resort, I was surprised with the room given to me. The room does not have space and arrangements as to what can be seen in app. I contacted MMT support for 7-8 times to get things verified and to get this sorted with help but I have not received any help neither callback. I have also sent the images of room via email but to no avail. Really disappointed with the services."
"Ricky of India, Other"," April 12, 2019",Booked a flight with this company. They did not correctly spell the name. They issued an e-ticket for the wrong time. There was no flight at time issued on the ticket. I phoned and e-mailed many times to get this resolved. Staff lack of interest in resolving anything. I did travel on the flight as all the details were incorrect due to negligence of this company. If anyone is reading this PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY for any of your bookings as you will suffer financially and stress in resolving any issues.
"Hasitha of Dublin, Other"," April 11, 2019",They don't take any responsibility at all. When the airline cancelled their flight in a transit airport. They said that they would refund the booking amount after talking to them for 2 hours on the phone and not give a different flight or hotel to stay in. We had to pay double price to make a booking with different airlines and 4 days of hotel stay price. Worst agency ever. Stay away from this site.
"Lakshmi of Greensboro, NC"," April 11, 2019",They are a hoax. This is the worst ever travel agency. They are the least helpful and worst customer service ever. They cancelled a part of a reservation and never bothered to email me. I had to book a separate ticket directly with an international airline.
"Devadath of Cumming, GA"," April 7, 2019","I try to book a ticket through this site and it charged my card and gave me the message below. ""Your booking has failed. We are sorry, your booking has failed however your card has been charged. Your payment has been sent for refund processing and you will receive it back in 3 working days."" As booking failed I decided to book tickets through a different site and then 12 hours later MakeMyTrip.com went ahead and booked ticket. Now I have another set of tickets for my travel and has been more than 5 days waiting for refund for their goof up. Please keep off from this site for any booking. Thank you."
"Shruthi of Bengaluru, Other"," March 29, 2019","We wanted to book a hotel closer to Grant Medical College. The address showed on MMT website while booking was 2 km from the college and they also matched the confirmation message sent to us on WhatsApp. However, the hotel booked by MakeMyTrip was 60km away from actual place. When we tried to contact MMT, no phone numbers were working, not even the one provided on the booking invoice! "
"Jitesh of Agra, Other"," March 28, 2019",I booked a flight ticket for going to my sister's marriage. Due to some reason marriage date is changed. Two time I called to company to to reschedule the date every time the change the penalty price and now they the price of penalty is equal to the flight ticket. I gave the worst review to the MakeMyTrip. It's my first time and so-called last time also. I prefer the other brand because they never disappoint me. If there are zero rating I definitely give it zero.
"Simar of Montreal, QC"," March 26, 2019","I made a booking with MakeMyTrip. When I got my itinerary in 3 hours. I noticed that they have misspelled my name on the ticket. When I tried to contact them back, it took me 2 hours to get in contact with the agent. Also, in spite of helping me have correct name, she said you have to get a new ticket by paying whole amount again. Not only this, she said MakeMyTrip will charge 20,000/- INR to cancel previous booking. It was not even 12 hours when I booked my flight. When I tried to check out that why do I have to lose so much money, she hang up on my face. So, people please never book flight with MakeMyTrip. Worst service I ever came across. Save your money. Book with others not MakeMyTrip."
"Abhishek of Other, Other"," March 26, 2019","I have recently booked a hotel booking of 2 two Rooms through MakeMyTrip.

I called them regarding the same issue within 5 minutes and they are not were of no help. I was told to book it again at the new price which was a rs 15000 more expensive. "
"Jyothi of Other, Other"," March 25, 2019",I booked hotel at Coorg through MakeMyTrip app. It was OYO room at Hill View Hotel. Next day I received SMS from OYO asking me to pay advance amount to confirm my booking & I paid. In spite of payment I received SMS one week later that my booking cancelled for non receipt of payment. My hectic efforts to resolve my issue went in vain as neither MakeMyTrip nor OYO responding properly.
"Jay of New York, NY"," March 22, 2019","I booked ticket from Kathmandu to Delhi. In the e-ticket was written that the cancellation fee will be 2530 and MakeMyTrip fee will be 649. But, when I need to cancel the ticket, they added convenience fee of about 900 extra. They do not clearly."
"Sanjeev of Greater Noida, Other"," March 22, 2019",Fraud in cancellation charge. Very bad agency. After cancellation airlines returned 9000 rupees but MakeMyTrip returned me 90 rupees. It is totally fraud. I request you please do not book ticket through this agency.
"François of Other, Other"," March 21, 2019","Every dealing with MakeMyTrip is a source of problem, The system doesn't recognize international numbers and it remembers a wrong 10 digits number you are supposed to know, if not the call centre doesn't answer your calls! The system blocked my computer IP so that I can't login anymore. The chat system only answers stupid basic questions and never transfers you to an agent. When you finally manage to talk to a commercial agent, he doesn't transfer you to technical support, and only tells you ""wrong number"" and hangs up. If you are an international traveller and have LOTS of time and money to waste, buy your next flight or hotel through MakeMyTrip.com."
"Vinay of Bangalore, Other"," March 21, 2019","I had booked cab for midnight 3am. Cab driver did not received call, MMT not ready to refund also, booking ID NC **. Loss of money & time.

But once I reached Sweden need to change return flight but not able to contact customer support over telephone on provided numbers and trying to change online but it's not working. After sale service is so much pathetic. Suggesting not to buy return tickets on MakeMyTrip."
"Ravi of Other, Other"," March 20, 2019",I booked an international flight and due to auto fill option my name was spelled wrongly and it's been 8 days and am still chasing them to do the needful. Called at least 15-20 times and every agent says he will do it straight away and no one tends to follow up. Seriously MMT is full of crap.
"Neha of Other, Other"," March 20, 2019","I booked Saffron Stays at Matheran through MakeMyTrip, for which I paid Rs.6300 for 1 person. After some time on the same day, I have modified my booking and added one more guest. For adding the guest, they have considered my earlier booking as cancelled and charge me again for new booking. If I am not changing the date, why they considered it as cancelled. Rules for cancellation, Modification and addition of extra guests should be different. They charge penalty for cancellation or date of change is okay. But if I am adding the guest within 15 min, then they can't consider it as cancelled. It’s just a tactic for incurring the more money. They are just Fooling the customers like this."
"Alok of Other, Other"," March 19, 2019",I reserved bus ticket from Moradabad to Lucknow on 20/03/2019 at 12am. Now it is 1:45 am at boarding point. There is no any update regarding my bus. I have only my MMT PNR numbers which is meaningless for anyone. For MMT you are starting loot.
"Suhas of Other, Other"," March 19, 2019","I have booked holiday package from MakeMyTrip. During booking they committed your trip will be memorable. Yes this is very true, my trip was memorable but not good view. It's bad view. Very bad experience during trip with their travel Partner Amara Travel from Chandigarh. Driver is only working for commission. Wherever they got the commission they stop vehicle on that places."
"bvs of Hyderabad, Other"," March 19, 2019","Hi guys, I will suggest all my buddies never ever book or plan trip through MakeMyTrip. These guys suck all the time without any results. They will give complete wrong itinerary (Given wrong itinerary).

"Suyash of Nha Trang, Other"," March 8, 2019",I have been trying to resolve an issue with them since 10th February when they booked us into a hotel which doesn’t exist in BANGKOK. I have been trying to get my money back since then but these people forgot to learn about customer experience. Forget about the apology or the compensation. I have been begging to get my money back which I paid for invisible hotel but they are waiting for me to get tired and forget about the issue. I even copied their CEO and rest of the management team into emails but they are too busy cheating their consumers.
"Bharat of Mumbai, Other"," March 8, 2019",I booked a Phuket holiday package for me and my wife through MMT for our wedding anniversary which was plan all of sudden 3 days before trip. I spoke to MMT team and they gave me offer which I felt was best for this sudden international trip. Everything was great till I landed in Phuket. I waited almost 2 hours at airport as they were waiting for other passenger to arrive. This was one incident which seems normal as it was already mentioned that pick up and drop was on share basis. Once I reached at hotel I felt like I am going to check in some kind of basic rooms 2 star property instead of a 4 star property which was promised in my package. Anyways it was a 3 star (as per Google) property. Not a 4 star (A big lie by MMT team). 
"Jyoti of Santa Clara, CA"," March 6, 2019",They totally fooled us. The customer services have no knowledge about booking flights keeping us on hold for ton of hours. Very bad service. We didn't receive refund for the flight cancellation. Please save time and money. Avoid this company.
"Preethi of Bangalore, Other"," March 5, 2019","We recently had a family trip to Singapore (4N5D) and I had no clue I would face such bad experiences. The service was so bad. No proper communication. All the pick up from the hotel would be delayed but they expect you to come on time while dropping back. Hotel they had booked had such bad rooms. I would REALLY NOT recommend MMT. They have all the jazz before we make the booking, give you all the fancy itinerary, but everything changes once the full payment is made. I can go on and on with the bad experiences!!"
"Sreejith of Thrissur, Other"," March 4, 2019","I had booked a ticket from Kochi to Manchester and back for the 15th of March and 23rd of March respectively. Due to unforeseen problems, I had to change my dates. I ended up calling their customer care for a quote. I was pleased to know that it could be done for around 12000 RS. I repeatedly asked them what was the total cost and they assured me it was about 12000 RS. Imagine my horror when, after I had paid 12000 by credit card, they inform me that that was for a single flight and the total comes up to 38000. Had I known, it would have been easier to just book another flight. One of my worst experiences ever."

I tried this several time and finally saw that Feb 27th was selected. However after I paid, the ticket indicated a date of March 27, 2019. I discovered this only on reaching the airport."

I've booked my tickets from USA to India, needed help with date change as I had an emergency and would not be able to make it on the previous dates I booked. These guys have the worst customer service! They are super annoying and neither of them has any knowledge on what to do to get things going. I've been trying to get them to finish my job from the last 10 days and only to my disappointment that the process still continues. Extremely unprofessional and ridiculous!"

But when we checked that with the hotel, we were informed that they do not have that amenity for those rooms. MMT just uses fake and false data to attract people. Kindly check hotel Country Inn and Suites by Radisson in Mussoorie. MakeMyTrip shows all rooms with bathtub facility to attract customer whereas if you check with the hotel, hotel gives the knowledge that they have this amenity only for suites and not for superior and duplex rooms."
"Prasanna of Bangalore, Other"," Feb. 28, 2019","Makemytrip recently credited a UDF refund amount of Rs. 1057 into ""My Cash Account"". This UDF refund was due to a Govt policy change related with Delhi Airport. (My flight was in the sector BLR-DEL-BLR.) As a customer I had paid cash to purchase the ticket at a specific price. Further the Government implemented a policy change resulting in a refund of certain amount. Instead of paying back the refund amount to the customer Makemytrip holds our money in what they call ""My Cash Account"" merely POINTS. The customer has no choice but to purchase additional services from Makemytrip in order to avail the refund. This is a shameless business strategy to say the least. If this is not cheating what else could this be? Hope the Govt. authorities take notice of this. It's not merely about announcing policy changes but to ensure that consumers get their dues."

I don't have that amount of money, and how sure am I that I will be refunded within that time frame, I live in South Africa and cannot call them. This is very deceiving as according to their website, prices were supposed to go up later today, but quite the opposite. Their policy of a refund of 10x the difference, is not applicable."

You can kindly book again.” I booked again. The same thing happened again. Card deducted and didn't get any confirmation message or mail. Again same repeated words from the customer care.

We saved up for a couple of months and were very eagerly looking forward to this trip. We made one mistake while planning this trip, which was choosing MakeMyTrip for our ticketing and visa needs.

(If MMT require any pictures, I have all the photograph with me.) Before checkin , I confirmed on hotel reception about spa facility. They said Yes, later on they denied. Pool is also closed, Don't know why. I would never suggest anyone to visit Dee Marks, and MMT should take care of their customer as they are medium in between customer and hotel. So, Really pathetic experience with Both Dee Marks and MakeMyTrip as no one helped me out. I suffered the loss."

Every time they change their words and creates a terrible atmosphere for holidays. MMT is looting hard earned money through fake advertisements and promotions. Therefore, I request you not to avail MMT packages."

Secondly, they change details of your feed data to original default data without your notice. You only come to know after payment done. I never recommend any one to book through MMT. Beware MMT (Maha Maha Tharki). FARE SUMMARY 1 BASE FARE Rs. 5,273 TAXES & SURCHARGESRs. 1,119 TOTAL SERVICESRs. 254 GRAND TOTAL Rs. 6,646.

My first experience 2012-June-19, MakeMyTrip offered ticket at a better rate and I was stuck at the airport due to US transit. This is the responsibility of MakeMyTrip to show the customers with visa related information if at all required due to Transit.

Indigo Air web page also does not recognize our reservation due to MakeMyTrip's. This is the worst booking experience we have had."
Uday of India," Jan. 20, 2019","We had booked this hotel through Make My Trip. The location is not on the beach, as claimed but in a dirty lane. The rooms are dirty with broken furniture, filthy bathroom, and service is very bad.The balcony wall was broken and overlooked another very dirty building that was hardly 5-6 feet away from the room. The whole atmosphere was extremely disappointing and depressing. The hotel is frequented by bachelors in large groups, and not meant for decent families. There was loud talking, laughter and fooling around from one of the rooms right through the night up to 2. a.m. Complaining to the staff was of no use."

They don't bother about customer once the payment is done, works only 10 to 6, Sunday and general holidays no one will help up, it's shuts down. We had booked the tickets and applied visa. But didn't receive visa till the end. We lost our money as the flight departed. Careless people, no one contacts irrespective of many emails. Worst company, don't go for it."

Iswar of India," Jan. 1, 2019","Worst service ever by MMT. 2 star hotel (Hotel Suntej Plaza) was given to me for Nainital which looked like a slum. It was actually not a hotel even. The room was like a store room, sofa was broken, the blankets and sofa covers were torn. The bedsheets were not clean, there was no water, the tv was not functioning, no towels were given, no soap and shampoos were given and charged 2000 inr per day for that room which is not worth paying even 600 rs per day. Room service was poor. No room heater was given. Geyser was not functioning. The window was broken. Abhi jug was given instead of a mug. The toilet was dirty. Overall it was a nightmare for me.

They keep on saying, ""Wait for 48 hrs. Wait for 48 hrs."" That's the only thing they know, I'm wondering if didn't confirm with the hotel and if we went there then I think we should have sleep on the road because of them. Screw you guys."
Brett of Australia," Dec. 2, 2018",Annoying experience. Payment is a nuisance if you are a foreigner (often impossible) and customer service is pretty much non-existent. I see they have consistently bad reviews and it seems if there is any sort of issue that arises they don't really help or care. Probably best avoided. For third party transport booking something like Cleartrip is a better option.

The MakeMyTrip staff Nitin purposely insisted on this hotel vouching to be the best with excellent customer reviews which was an absolute lie. Booking.com reviews clearly indicate this but MMT promised that the reviews trustable. We feel cheated by MakeMyTrip. Stay : 13 - 17th Nov 2018."

Took several pictures to send MakeMyTrip and to ask for reimbursement, but no help whatsoever. Their itinerary for us was ridiculous and the sites we were meant to see we didn't due to the fact we were driving for up to 11.5 hrs every day! The only good thing of the whole trip was the driver Rinku who worked for another company. DO NOT USE MAKEMYTRIP as they aren't reputable. Wish I'd have read reviews before booking through them."

On calling MMT they put me on hold for more than 30 mins and said that Air India has no option to book seats. But MMT had shown me the seat matrix at the time of booking, let me book the seats with 500 extra bucks. Now they just apologized and said that I have to choose whatever seats are left from the airline's website. Moreover they agreed to return only Rs.400 not Rs.500."

When I called back this was not canceled. I followed up multiple times but I have never seen such useless customer support and unethical company who just wants to cheat. Out of the entire amount of 25 only return amount of 4K was refunded even after informing much in advance and following up continuously. I would suggest people to go to respective airlines and book ticket and do not use MakeMyTrip."
Rajinder of India," Nov. 5, 2018","I opted to book a international flight from DEL to DUS for 19-12-2018. The amount asked for was immediately paid through HDFC credit card and the amount was debited to my account. Withing seconds message was flashed that ""booking failure"". Now I have to wait for refund and also go for new booking and also has to extra charges without any fault on my part. It advised for others to avoid booking through MakeMyTrip."
"Deepthi of Other, India"," Nov. 5, 2018",MakeMyTrip booked our hotel in Salem as per a deal which we thought was very good. Unfortunately when we reached there we realised they were just cheating us. And their marketing fellow pretending to be very gracious offered us a refund. Imagine being stuck in an alien land with a toddler and an old mother with no room at 11 p.m! And now I am not able to log onto their site to lodge a formal complaint because their site doesn't have such a feature. They just promise and cheat! So my advice is... don't be fooled by their deals. They are just cheats.
Garima of India," Nov. 3, 2018","The way customer manager showed the details was good enough intially, when it was told to reveal the verification and details of the hotel rooms and charges, they were like, ""Finish your trip then will show you."" Really? That was the real shock, I tried talking to the senior person related to above but he was not willing to talk because he doesnt like talking to customers. They have lot of hidden charges which they show when the final payment is to be done. I will never ever recommend anyone MAKE MY TRIP. The most pathetic experience I ever had."

I have had countless amount to of issues with MakeMyTrip, especially with the MakeMyTrip support team. I had an urgent matter which requires me to change my ticket and it was near impossible for me to reach the company. Every single call I made ended with an operator speaking and then automatically hanging up. I have never in my life come across a company where an operator hangs up on you, it's absolutely ** pathetic."
"SUNITA of Bengaluru, Other"," Oct. 29, 2018",I booked a flight ticket with ** for the sector BBI to BLR in AirAsia flight for the ticket cost of Rs. 6910. They gave me an invoice of Rs. 6860 (less Rs 50/-). I highlighted them the discrepancy. Then they immediately sent me a revised invoice for an amount of Rs. 6910. I noticed that they have now shown in the revised invoice an increase of Rs. 50/- in the AirAsia flight ticket cost. I went to AirAsia website and checked the ticket cost for this PNR. Surprisingly the cost shows in the AirAsia website what was shown in the first invoice. Then I contacted MMT and pointed out that the revised invoice is a fake invoice by showing the snapshot of AirAsia website ticket cost for this particular PNR. They reviewed my complaint and refunded me Rs. 50/-.
Chandni of Other," Oct. 29, 2018","I booked 2 tickets from their app. I cancelled one and kept the other by selecting option cancel partial booking. But the whole booking got cancelled. I asked them to charge me cancellation for one ticket only. They send me emails asking me for Visa rejection papers for the ticket I had to cancel. They just don't understand that the problem is the ticket I didn't want to cancel but got cancelled due to some problem in their app. When I called customer care the agent said that option of cancel partial booking doesn't exist! Then how did I get that option? They send me emails saying ""as per our discussion on call"" when I hadn't called them at all. I called them after getting the emails which made me understand that they don't don't even know the problem. I don't know when my ordeal will end. Don't book tickets from these online sites. Better to do from a travel agent."

The MyWallet to me seems a total hoax, with not even 1Re. payment possible even with 2100 balance. I finally forsook that option to somehow complete the transaction within my time frame. Repeated emails & phone calls to customer care are proofs I have to show their lethargic attitude to customers, except for a Mr. Anand ** who patiently tried to help out. Any travel agent if I had approached could have given same whole deal & finished it within 30 mins max! Disappointing."

Their customer team realized it when I called them up. Have promised to book us on another flight, but still no steps taken on their behalf. This is an International flight and our Visa depends on such bookings. They are thieves. The customer support staff is brainless! One of their executive told me to wait for 48 hours for an action to be taken. When I refused, he taunted me by saying, ""If you can spend two minutes in talking to me, then you can definitely wait 48 hours!!!"" This is the type of service they give people... at least provide the customer with an end to end result! I am furious at such service. What's worse, they won't even accept it to be their fault! Pathetic people."

But last day he charge 35 Dirham to saying some things used in mini bar. I have nothing used. This was totally penalty to not change room in presence. MakeMyTrip booked my trip for 6 nights but three nights was no any activities. They only increase tour period. Desert Safari and Cruise dinner was very ordinary. Very cheap cruise.

SAKET of India," Oct. 18, 2018",The below review/feedback is posted to make everyone aware of the facts that MMT even being a brand name is troubling its customers & creating a negative impact in the minds of its customers by just using its name to make money & not taking care of its customer satisfaction by providing quality services. The below are the issues faced by us:
Yash of Other," Oct. 17, 2018","I had done booking on 17 Oct 2018 at 7.45 p.m and had for flight from Dubai to Mumbai on 14 Nov 18 and mistakenly choose the wrong time and informed the change in mins that is at 8.00 p.m that need to change the timings as my rest family is travelling 3.50 p.m and I had chose the time for me at 1.10 p.m. 1st they say that the Emirates airline charges money for time change, so I called up the airline and asked them about the same so they said that the airline doesn't charge anything and to make changes in the timing I have to ask MakeMyTrip. So when I confronted with the supervisor at the MakeMyTrip he called up the airlines and asked for the information which was shared to me by airlines and he agreed that the airline won't charge but as the booking is done from MakeMyTrip they (MakeMyTrip) can't do anything. It's worst service I have ever seen after airlines confirming that they don't charge for such thing still MakeMyTrip wants to charge."
Pooja of India," Oct. 16, 2018",I made a booking at Nainital through MMT. The hotel was not at all up to our expectations. We had booked considering it to be one of the best hotels with high ratings and the room was with a tariff of 12k which is pretty high. But when we found the property to be absolutely contrary to our expectations and we asked MMT to look into the matter and cancel booking for one day at least (we had a booking for 2 nights) they did nothing about it. They just waived off from their end saying nothing can be done from their end until the hotel management accepts a cancellation while the hotel management said that it can be done only by MMT.

Have uploaded snaps and videos for same on website."
Shivi of India," Oct. 11, 2018",Services of MMT is worst and I booked a room in Hotel Lords that was also not as per my expectations and instruction... Both combinedly fool people and do not tell all conditions at the time of booking then charged more. Staff of Hotel Lords is not cooperative and manager has no sense of talking with female clients. I am very disappointed from the services given by hotel and MMT as well... MMT cheats people by initially showing less price and while booking increases the price (excluding taxes). I'll never suggest anyone to MakeMyTrip. I wasted my time here for hotel room booking. And even tried to find ways to match the initial price and booking amount price but couldn't get success. LIARS MMT!!
"Pranita of Cupertino, CA"," Oct. 8, 2018",I booked international package through MMT. They are total unprofessional. No proper procedure and every step you need to spend your time for follow-ups. Their visa agent name Aditi ** is the worst lady and with lot of headstrong. She provided all the wrong details and top of it her behavior is like she is the SMARTEST PERSON on this earth. Poor knowledge and lack of process makes me to write the review. If you are going to book any holiday package from MMT then please spare time for follow-ups. Nobody will give you call or update you the status. It's you need to do everything.
"Ganesh of India, India"," Sept. 28, 2018","I asked for the breakup of invoice amount as onward ticket cost and return ticket cost. The MakeMyTrip customer care did not respond properly and unilaterally closed the request saying that this is a single trip only and no cost breakup could be provided. Further, the staff asked me to book two different tickets to get breakup of invoice amount. MakeMyTrip technology is developed in such a way that cost breakup is not available on a roundtrip booking for sharing with passengers."

The plan was to have one of the best trips with a group of friends and picked up alcohol and barbecue set to cook meat from Bangalore. Although, we did not know what we were in for was a worst getaway ever for the next 2 days, do read below to understand why: 1) The Hotel on arrival told us that they do not serve alcohol and nor do they allow alcohol to be consumed in their premises. 2) They also told us they serve only vegetarian food and on our request of cooking barbecue told us that is not possible."
Nitin of India," Sept. 20, 2018","I will write my full review about MakeMyTrip. I had seen one Nepal tour package of 6D/5N with flights and all day to day activities with private car and 3 stars hotels its was showing 27500+ INR per person. If I book for 2 travelers I would get 18500+ INR discount so I calculated my amount its was 36500+ INR + taxes so not more than of 40000 INR for 2 travelers. When I tried to book its was showing me 73600+ INR and after discount deduction its was 58600+ INR + taxes. This clearly show that MMT is just showing less price to attractive customers and when you checkout it would increase a lots. I did some more research and did individually than the Nepal tour with same day to day activities, car, hotels etc everything with taxes included was not gone more than of 37000 INR."

When I understood the mistake and managed to re-schedule the travel date through the App and website it says call the customer support toll free number as re-scheduling cannot be done online. When called the customer support they re-directed to do online and say they cannot do it. Are you ** kidding? Do you think we are jobless scratching our ** off doing nothing? I have lost a day's pay off only because trying to call and get in touch with any travel executive of MakeMyTrip.com. And moreover this is not the first experience.

Arvind of India," Sept. 3, 2018",MMT guys are not providing the rooms in discounted price when their partnered hotels are providing. It is always better to verify the prices of their partnered hotels first directly rather than blindly booking from these travel sites. I have experienced such issue recently when I physically got to know during the stay at the hotel. The partner hotel were offering 50% discount but MakeMyTrip were charging their customers at regular price and were not ready to compensate for the same.

For collecting the extra charge they cannot confirm roadmap. For any issue MakeMyTrip executive are not interested to clear the same time and disconnecting the telephone line.

Vijeta of India," Sept. 1, 2018","I had planned for a third tour with MakeMyTrip and this was again bad experience. We had planned our international tour and the team had rushed on the bookings and embassy visit without properly verifying the documents for embassy visit as they have a team who gives assistance. Our Visa got rejected and before that date itself we were rushed to make the full payment of the tour. Now we didn't had enough time to reapply as our tour date was after 8 days and due to which they asked us to either bear penalty if wanted to change tour date which was a lakh or whole the if we cancel the whole amount will go in their pocket. I had tried to reach all the team and without giving any justification from higher authorities they just say, ""Sorry. We tried best but couldn't do anything."""

The places that I opted for are Delhi, Agra, Rishikesh, Haridwar and Dehradun. I have made this explicit initially itself but when the CS executive sent me the itinerary list for the locations that I asked for, she sent very minimal places for every location. Say 2-3 places at max. When I asked for more, it was too many to and fro to make her understand my requirement. Finally, I got frustrated and I came up with the full plan for 8 days and gave her. Her work is just to send this to the backend team to get the quote for it. The amount she quoted was bit high but I did not worry about it much. "

After pulling ourselves together we decided to go back to railway station and ask someone for help. Over there, the DB Kiosk came to our rescue out of this mind numbing shock to us. They spent some time and finally found the actual name and number of the owner of the apartment. They called the owner and asked for the address and finally got the correct address. "
"Maharshi of Vadodara, Other"," June 21, 2018",Our return tickets from Frankfurt to India were wrongly cancelled without informing us or even consulting the flight company Fly Emirates to know the reason of why we didn't board the flight. Mind you that it is mandatory for MakeMyTrip to consult the concerned Airport before updating the status/reason of the flyer to boarding the flight. If they would have consulted the Airport then nothing of this had happened and our return ticket would be smooth without having to pay any NO SHOW charges. Now the airport updated the status to OFFLOAD of two (out of three) members of our trip. But MakeMyTrip marked it as NO SHOW. This caused all the issues making our return trip a dreadful nightmare. NO SHOW at Ahmedabad caused our return tickets to be SUSPENDED from Frankfurt.

You can call Hotline 18001028747 in case of any issue. Resolution within 60 minutes or Money Back.” After calling this no. I was assured that my problem of king will be solved in half an hour but after calling many times nothing happened and secondly the assured hotel doesn’t have wifi working as their server was down and breakfast was worsened than my life.

It was completely unorganized. Only accommodation was good, which you can book yourself better than MMT. Local trips were wrongly arranged. Two days were wasted in only for 2 hours travel per day. Accommodation was 4 stars and local trips were 3rd class."

I was assured that in case of flight delays if I inform the driver beforehand they won't charge for waiting. And our flight was delayed by 2 hours and now the driver is charging RS. 240. For waiting. Then since now we would reach after 9 pm the driver will charge additional 250 for night. And he is asking for additional 150 for airport entry. This is the worst cab experience ever. It really needs to be checked. I advise not to waste money in booking cabs with MMT.

Tickets were available @13500 on the official website but to save 500 INR I chose to book through MMT and that was my mistake to fall into their lure and cheat trap. After no cashback was credited, I mailed their customer care and they sent me a screenshot saying no code was applied from my end! The worse part is there is no proof to actually make my claim as they didn't mention anything about HDFCINT code in any of the bookings mail they generated, only proof was to take a screenshot of the booking page and who does that?

MMT's website is so weak that someone can access my account from different country. Looks like someone has used my id-password from their database. So it is MMT's fault not mine. I told MMT people that you got the proof that I have not requested for any cancellation, so you should give my money back.

Every time I had to call them myself to ask about update and every freaking time they asked to wait for 24 hrs. I had accepted their extra charges right away but they are utterly useless bunch of people sitting there. They don't write you email about the promises. If the request resolution is delayed they give you Rs. 1000 wallet cash that is of no use. Because you can only use 5% at a time for booking at it gets expired before even your request is resolved!!! MakeMyTrip was much better before. Now it is going downhills with no hopes of returning.

Decision, User Development fees charged from passengers towards Delhi airport was slashed to Rs10 for domestic passenger w.e.f. 07/07/2017 and airlines would refund the excess amount to the passenger for those who booked the ticket on or before 7 July but are yet to commence the travel. I paid user development fees @ Rs. 564 per passenger. I had not received any refund. I requested MMT on 31/12/2017 for refund of excess UDF. Even after expiry of one month, they refused to UDF refund for one reason or the another whereas Paytm has already refunded excess UDF for air ticket booked through them. Never book any air ticket through MakeMyTrip.com. They are cheater. Try other website."

With the temperatures at this place I at least expected AC to work properly and at least a bottle of water for free. "

"Mohita of Rajpur Chungi, Other"," Jan. 23, 2018",Booked a cab from Delhi airport to Agra. Ticket mentioned all toll included. They took the NH route because the toll is cheaper without prior information. They say that this is a shorter route in kms. But what about the unnecessary delay and the mental exhaustion caused by the traffic. Also the customer care personnel says I should have asked about the route. Highly unprofessional. At least these things should be clarified beforehand. Enticing customers by cheap offers. Disgusting.
"Trinath of Bangalore, Other"," Jan. 19, 2018","MMT is bluffing people in showing that the accommodation is present and 'Book now' being active, when I click on it it turns into 'Sold out'. This happens for most of the hotels. This is a bluff by MMT. Don't know why it is doing that. What is the fun in showing book now when it's sold out! Besides, for the cases where it does go to the next screen, it says prices have decreased but to our surprise, it's far higher than what is show on the previous screen. This again is a bluff. This business must be made to shut down if it does not mend its ways!"

Is this how MMT want to cheat their customers? Now the customer care people are citing the fine prints in their T&Cs about this stupid scheme!!! I would call out this bluff of MMT to all the users and recommend not to opt for this fraud scheme as they may end up paying extra bucks but cannot achieve the end goal for getting their full money back in case they have to cancel their journey."

"Shilpi of Noida, Other"," Dec. 26, 2017","Here is complete feedback regarding the above booking. First of all there were few hitches at the time of booking itself regarding communication issues, so we just went ahead as is to save time and energy. Though scanned copies of Passports were made available as soon as booking was confirmed thru first payment, the validity of one passport was communicated after 5-6 days of sending it when docs were forwarded to visa dept. This caused last minute panic for renewing passport and lot of tension, stress and extra costs coordinating between 3 cities to get it renewed on urgent basis and this had financial implications too. Again we were lucky to get visas just 3 days before travel adding to our stress as the booking was under 100% cancellation charges clause, it being just a week before travel date. "

I traveled to Lucknow on 15th December 2017 and it was my first time. Booked online both Shatabdi and hotel. Hotel in question here is Sumitra. I already paid for my 2 nights/3 day visit prior but when I reached Sumitra Hotel, they adamantly asked for 300 extra. I had to call MakeMyTrip but they passed the buck on call even before 2 days after booking I spoke to MMT about extra person and they said they only need Primary information and not the extra person. Anyways, paid 300 bucks upfront at hotel for flaw in MakeMyTrip operations and mind you this is entirely unethical as whether it was 300 or 3000 they should inform or state on their website."

During the booking, customer care agent was damn nice to help me with the booking but ended up with cheating as to inform me that tickets are being sold so quick and I ended paying extra around 4000. On top of that, I was informed by the same agent that I can add extra luggage by calling the airline company. After booking, I call the airline company and they have denied. Secondly, the ticket booked by MakeMyTrip consists two airline companies and terrific thing is that both the airline companies do not have an agreement. Thus, one of my airlines informed me that they can't transfer my luggage directly to my destination."

After 2 days of waiting I send an email enquiring about booking. They replied my mail saying booking transaction was unsuccessful which is unbelievable. After taking my money from the bank this company is transaction is unsuccessful. This is completely like stealing money. This company is untrusted and unworthy. I just lose my Rs 5300 just like this. After few days I called to the customer support. He said me another story that my booking was confirmed and ticket had issued. Whereas as I travelled by another airlines. I always book ticket online it has never happen but in MakeMyTrip.com it happened like this. So I want to tell everyone please don't booked ticket through this site. It is so unsafe. Before booking the ticket please read the review.
"Rahul of New Delhi, Other"," Nov. 25, 2017","I booked a ticket for Lucknow from Delhi Anand Vihar ISBT for Nov-21.17 at 10:30 from MakeMyTrip.com. They provided me the booking of a bus which is not there at the stand at all (see the pic of ticket). When I called the number mentioned was in the ticket, that was switched off and the customer care of MakeMyTrip.com was saying we can't do anything for now, take an alternate. What they could do only, just raise a complaint regarding the issue according to their customer executive. I can't catch up my bus due to it and suffered a heavy loss of the time and amount of the ticket which was Rs 850 also Rs 1100 for taking an urgent bus reservation. I am now finding myself cheated and want the compensation for my loss. It is a humble request to all the travelers please don't use MakeMyTrip.com, these guys are making their customers fool and nothing else. I am now going to lodge a complaint in the consumer court."
"Rajiv of Noida, Other"," Nov. 24, 2017",Booked a one-way cab from Noida for 23/11/17 to drop at Agra. On its website the cars shown are very much clean and in new condition. Since I had booked an SUV expecting MakeMyTrip would send Innova or Xylo as they have displayed Innova only. When the cab arrived I was surprised it was a light Maruti Ertiga. Anyhow I had to travel at any cost. The driver drove at a speed of 130-140 km/hr on asking he replied he has to come back soon. What a service? Putting our lives on risk expressway. On contacting MakeMyTrip customer care I was informed the allowed speed is 60-80 km/hr only. Just see how the guy was crazy. Further the car was dirty. Not cleaned for so many days. Anyways my trip ends safely by the grace of God. I request all not to book cab from Makemytrip.com as you will not get the cab of your choice moreover putting your life on risk and facing unprofessional driver's behaviours.

I have contacted customer service and they said it will take time to resolve. I said okay but no calls. I have called the executive. He never answered my call. When called care the guy who is on call speaks very rudely and saying it's not MMT fault. If you want to change hotel change it by yourselves and make payment for it. Even I didn't get cab details on travel date as well. I called in between of journey to get cab details. Worst service and MMT executive are also very harsh and rude. Don't go with MMT.

Visa team sucks big time as they collect the document a week before the travel and no proper communication. I had to follow up multiple times on when the visa would be done.

Somehow I contacted IRCTC. They asked me to manage with the other passengers as nothing can be done now. Please directly book your tickets through IRCTC.

Many time I have noted suddenly at the moment of making the payment airfares suddenly go up by Rs 1000! Supposedly airlines suddenly increased the fare!

MMT advertises and encourages full refund for ppl who in advance pay money to them, in case of cancellation because of medical or any other emergencies. But In my case, these guys just paid mere 7.5 k back, and rest money they shamelessly said can't refund. Another strange thing I found is, they don't have any strict policy behind, making booking or making refunds, it just up to the person serving the request. Anybody who is going to use MMT for future trips, please beware and don't pay anything in advance, they’ll rob you."

I made booking for Mumbai to Mahabaleshwar and it was done fine, but when I did return booking from Mahabaleshwar to Mumbai twice I made the booking and made payment through net banking. First time it said, ""your booking could not be made, but the payment got debited."" I thought let's try for second time. Again it showed that my money is debited, but no confirm booking. I have already made payment twice and the amount comes to Rs. 3600. Without booking any bus seat, I have my money with MakeMyTrip. Though it is saying it will be credited, but kind of harassment, time, money and frustration that MakeMyTrip is giving is horrifying. Would request you all not to make payment online for bus booking with MakeMyTrip. Bad experience."

They replied, ""That is our cancellation policy."" I told them that these policy are one sided policy or disclaimers. This doesn't stand anywhere and if my visa was rejected and you are saying that this is not your fault, though even I'm saying the same that it is not my fault too, whatever the documents are required by you for visa I have sent you so why my visa is rejected that is your job.

Airline has revised fares for 23679. I again changed dates in same fare bracket and again this happened. Surprisingly after half an hour fare appearing was for 58780 and this was purely bluffing technique adopted by MakeMyTrip that when you finally click for payment fares are revised abruptly for higher amount.

When you need to change the date, they will send you to airline and airline sends back to MakeMyTrip saying, ""you are not our direct customer,"" and ""we don't take responsibility."" So it's better to book directly with airline rather than booking through MakeMyTrip. Yes it takes little longer but at least they respond if any changes or cancellation. MakeMyTrip is the worst at customer service. I don't want to give them even 1 star but since selection is necessary - I gave them."

When I inquired if there is a number to call on to check about making a booking the representative said there is none. The office is currently under process to be moved and that there is no number to call and no one to reach in order to make a booking. ""The employees who look after the new customer are here and there"" was the agent's words. So what sort of a company only deals with existing customer??

It is left to small tour operators which they engage in foreign counties. After this no customer care service works. There is no complaint cell where one can register his grievance or escalate the matter. I am giving day by day account of our trip in China.

When I was finally able to get through to them, I was told that the fare difference was now 3 times the original amount - all this because of the pathetic poor customer service they have in place.

When new vehicle arrived at airport, it was a nightmare experience for us. The driver was most arrogant and behaving like a third rate goonda. I was accompanying my aged parents with me and his behaviour towards them was unacceptable. MakeMyTrip had assigned the vehicle from a local taxi stand and not from reputed travels. I had to fight my case with the driver and had to threaten him with police complaint for his behaviour."

But Makemytrip agent insisted that this ticket will be booked by repeating firstname and lastname twice with Tanbir ** as he cannot proceed with booking if he leaves lastname blank. He went on and booked the ticket, but my son was refused to board the flight from Brisbane as the names on passport and ticket do not match."

"Savleen of Delhi, Other"," April 1, 2016",The worst place to book a holiday. People think that let them take some commission--at least we will have no problem--but no. Every day they are up with a new issue. Do we just have time to waste up out on them? On top of it they try to fool us by sending higher package cost 3-4 than what was decided and the person who has booked the package does not responds... it's not done yet then they make a 9 yrs old child an adult and say kuch nahi hota like seriously. Then they deny the fact I have personally asked them 2-3 times after getting the money. So do you want to leave your lovely trip in their deadly hands? I don't think so.

Most US online travel agencies allow for free cancellation within 24 hours, but MakeMyTrip did not even allow me 1 hour. The price on my ticket dropped within 30 minutes by almost $100, and a different airline dropped by $126. Since I am booking 4 tickets, I wanted to naturally avail of the $500 in savings. But MakeMyTrip would not allow me to change airline without penalty (even though they have not even issued ticket). Thank God they have agreed to honor new price on same airline, however, I am still at loss for almost $100."

We checked online price a few minutes later, it was low again. My guess is that they block overseas card transactions and when they call customer service they hike up the price.

I am a travel agent from South Africa and have been in the industry for 10 years and went to India for business, charity and leisure. Don't ever use them. They are a money making scheme and that's it. Their customer service and complaint center is useless. As a tourist and traveler to India if a travel agent can't work out how to use this site to its benefit then I don't know. We booked a train trip for four and once they took payment we were told it was on waitlist for a train the next day with over 30 people in the waiting list. We were then charged cancellation fees??? For a trip that couldn't be confirmed and we were never advised prior to paying that it was on waitlist."

Even though they sent us a confirmation of the booking. We then had to wait an hour while they argued with the hotel staff. Then they tried to rebook us to a hotel that was significantly lower quality than the hotel we had booked. We had to argue with them forever before they finally got us a hotel, which we were able to check into five afters after our original check in time."

They say in the case of no show tickets automatically get cancelled. They informed me about the cancelled ticket when just 10 days before my return date. Their customer care wasted a lot of my time and I ended up buying a new ticket from India to USA. They cheated $2500 from me. I would recommend not to buy ticket from makemytrip. Best way to get cheapest ticket is to first search using google flight and then directly booking tickets from the airlines website.

Customer support either disconnects the call or say they will work with accounts or the airline (airline confirmed that they have refunded). They are not also able to tell me my refund amount, leave alone ETA. They keep telling me that they are not allowed to give out any information. It is my money and my information... What information are they talking about. This has caused a lot of hassle. It is better to book directly than use MakeMyTrip. Never ever using MakeMyTrip. Sorry to say ""Horrible"" customer service is the only word for MakeMyTrip."

And they say they do not have the phone number of the insurance company they partner with. Extremely harassed. I am going to go out of my way to make sure nobody of the thousands people I know use this website and get to have similar harrowing experiences. While sharing word about this, I just got to know that another friend was charged an amount higher than the one mentioned in the invoice. Customers have to be compensated for this."

My friend had booked a packaged trip for an international destination from MAKE MY TRIP from Dubai. The cost for the trip was 7500 AED (135000 Indian Rupees). For some reason they had to cancel the trip 5 days before the travel and had informed Make my Trip via email and also by calling them.

I booked the ticket through MakeMyTrip.com well before actual date of travel and as expected received the email from MakeMyTrip about ticket confirmation. I believed in the email and was relieved but... I was not aware that it was just a myth because the ticket was never confirmed with the respective airlines. I came to know about it when I tried to do web check-in on airline's website and received error because it cannot find that booking. Thinking of it as technical problem I called their customer care and they confirmed that there is no booking. Running out of time I need to book ticket the same day paying double the price of what I used to book the ticket earlier.

They are taking 400 as MakeMyTrip service fee. Still they took twice the tariff and totally cheated us. This kind of worst behavior was not expected from MakeMyTrip."

From the moment I clicked BUY I knew I would regret my decision and it has been a nightmare ever since. Zero customer care, Zero interest in helping a client, and absolutely ridiculous charges. For the love of God DO NOT, under any circumstance do business with these people at MakeMyTrip.ae No matter how cheap.

It is horrible experience to deal with them if you are outside India.
"Giri of Bangalore, Other"," Sept. 11, 2015",Don't book any hotels via MakeMyTrip.com. They are just simply cheat and loot you. Here is my experience with MakeMyTrip.com. I have booked the hotel via MakeMyTrip and reached the hotel and surprisingly MakeMyTrip people doesn't send the confirmation to the Hotel guys and hence they denied to allow me. Then immediately I called up the customer care and the guy who attended my call was not able to figure out the booking as they are tied up with all the cheap hotels in the same street. So finally they either couldn't find my booking and didn't offer an alternate. So I have decided to pay money from my pocket (even I have a booking) and stayed. Later I ask then for cancellation and refund as it was completely their failure. Then they agreed (thank god they agreed) and said refund was done.

When I checked with MakeMyTrip, they wrote that they charged me Rs 800 as a CONVENIENCE fee for putting me in a very big INCONVENIENCE.

They are not refunding the amount which they said they will and after cancellation, they are changing the refund amount. Very bad experience, will surely not use MakeMyTrip again. Goibibo is much better than MakeMyTrip."
"Linoy of Dubai, Other"," May 5, 2015",I had purchased a ticket on 27/04/2015 for travelling with my family from Dubai to Cochin and return. But 3 days before the travel I had to change my return date from 16th May to 21st May. I called them 4 times on 4/5/2015 and each time after a long waiting period they would come up with an answer that you have to pay Dhs 330/person for date change which I agreed. Then they would keep on hold and this time 4 of them had different reasons to avoid the date change. First guy says to call after 1 hour. Second guy kept on hold and disconnected suspiciously. 3rd Lady said there were no seats available for 21/22/23. When I told her that I could see seats available online on their site as well as official site of the airlines she said that she has live update on seats availability. So I asked her does that mean yours and official site of airlines are faking the availability of seats which is a logical doubt and she disconnects.

Moreover their services towards my refunding matter is ** as while I was booking my flight they were really kind, but on refunding time now they are so rude and wasting my approx 160 dollar to call them everyday. They even not give my call to their supervisor and every time put me on 20 mins hold. Moreover, my experience towards MakeMyTrip is pissed me off.

But at the time of first call no one has said about rescheduling of 15 min will not get full refund. There is only information available about refund money you will get if ""airline give full refund"" and there is no information given in anywhere in your mail about rescheduling of flight.

"Rajita of East Lansing, MI"," April 23, 2015",They are a travel agency but they treat customers with the least bit of concern. All I wanted was a change of ticket due to change in travel date. It took me nearly 8 hours to get connected. They have inexperienced customer service representatives who kept on hanging up every time when they could not answer. They were rude in their replies. Treated me as if they were doing favor to me. It is not worth spending money and get humiliated by such people who do not care even if you are ready to pay. I finally had to buy a fresh ticket from the airline since they did not help me. I ended up wasting my return ticket back to the United States. Think twice before you make the mistake to call them just because their website shows first in Google search. I will never recommend them to other people.

Firstly when we reached Dubai the first bump we received was that we came to know our tour planner had completely dumped us. As ensured by him just a night before the trip that all our documents were complete was a total lie. The tour was completely missing the sightseeing package details and also no reference ID of our actual Gulliver's travel sightseeing planner was not mentioned - no name of tour guide, no contact details...nothing. We were ensured that the trio pack word itself included all our sightseeing details but it was a cheating.

Had undergone a bitter experience like not getting in time response to repeated mails and directing the passenger to do the cancellation quoting budget airline. At the worst of all, if called on toll-free, keeping it ringing for long period and later putting on hold for some pretext. If it's a fresh booking call, are attended at the first ring itself. Customer care supervisor intervention when sought always declined, and calls getting disconnected rudely. As the higher management is incapable of taking care of happenings at various offices for the reason grown too big for economy/budget passengers, this is a heads up to fellow members to think of an alternative before opting for MakeMyTrip."

They keep you on long holds of 20-25 minutes, transfer you to the wrong department, put you on further long holds while transferring, until one hangs up in frustration.

Planning a trip with your company was definitely memorable as I now know never to book with your company or even recommend any of my family and friends either. It all started when I decided to spend 5 days in Goa around New Years Eve. I booked my trip with Samim ** from the Delhi. The trip total came to 68,000 Rs. which included flight from Delhi to Goa, 4 nights at Hotel Colva Kinara, and a flight from Goa to Mumbai. I had requested Hotel Colva Kinara after finding out that other hotels were charging an extra fee for a New Years Eve Party.

While issuing the ticket the service was so impressive, a guy called me and facilitated the booking. Now real trouble started after a week when I had to prepone the same flight for just one day. Reaching them was the first step for date change since they only take call immediately on ""New Booking Link"" but for ""Existing Booking"" they will make you wait for Minimum 30 minutes to 60 Minutes. A guy took a call, charged a handsome amount of 9000 INR (where as the flight booking charge was 15000) and took the request for date change.

There was a booking for a tempo traveler which was supposed to pick us up at the cochin airport at 9.00 pm. We were told that the driver will be a tourist guide and will take care of us for the sightseeing. The driver will be knowing hindi and english. We were surprised to see that the tempo traveler arrived at 9.30 pm at the airport. We were stranded at the airport for half an hour. On meeting the driver we also came to know that the driver knows only malayalam and does not know hindi and english. It was really surprising. But we thought we will adjust. The driver was constantly on his cell phone during the entire travel. We kept on telling him not to use the cell phone but all in vain.

On 31st of Dec when I talked with them, he told me that for changing my ticket I have to pay penalty fee of $150 and $100 is the fare difference for the ticket.

Even after paying pull money don't even bother to call you back with details of travel documents. You will need to call them and follow up with them. The employees are so unfriendly they will not respond to calls, they will not respond to mails and no one from makemytrip will actually revert back to you. 15 days before the trip they send you air tickets which are actually fake and cancelled tickets. With my experience I feel I have lost all my money and will be filing for police case today for sending me a fake ticket and screwing up entire money. I have lost 1.5 lakhs for which I have not got any air tickets, no travel vouchers and no receipts.
